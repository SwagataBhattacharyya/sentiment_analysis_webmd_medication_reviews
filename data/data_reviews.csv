83,Aller-Flo Nasal,2/8/2022,,Male,6 months to less than 1 year,Patient,Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy,5.0,5,5,5,"During fifty years I have suffer of an allergy that blocked my left nose-thrill, gave me a pain in my left sinus and affected my speech, since I hear  my voice inside my left ear so, speaking in a loud voice, was very painful.
I spent thousands of dollars in visits to several of the best doctors, laboratory and  hearing tests, even a very famous doctor recommended me to insensibilize my left ear to finish this problem, that of course I did not accept.
I had  my nose septum straighter because one doctor said that was my problem. It did not helped, others gave me almost all the nose sprays available, did not work, other changed my food intake, did not work, and so on and so forth.
Finally I realized there was no cure for me and decided I had to live with this problem for the rest of my life.
Six months ago, accompanying my wife to a shopping mall I discovered Flo-nose, by curiosity and because of the good price and that it is sold over the counter I decided to give it a tray.
My great surprise was that at the first two shots my blocked nose-thrill and ear pain,  as I talked, improved so I decided to take a daily use for a long period of time and has really helped me, I can breath perfectly now and the ear problem has improved, although not at all, but I am confident that if I continue with its use I finally will be cured. 
Thank you Aller-flo and the scientists that developed this wonderful medicine.

I have BPH (enlarged prostate) for several years and knew I could not take an antihistamine with the warning on it: ""Do not take if you have an enlarged prostate"" (because within few days it can stop a man's urine flow!) I saw Claritin, a leading worldwide OTC drug and figured it must be special because it did not have this warning. I took it for over a year in 2016 and it worked great allowing me to do my job working 8-10 hours a day in medical  eqipment  business. Then in 02/2017 I immediately stopped taking it because urine flow stopped the first night of a week cruise. I had to have an internal catheter inserted connected to an external leg bag by cruise medical staff. After I got home it took my urologist 9 months to get my prostate back to normal and catheter removed. (it was removed several times during this time period but had to be reinserted within few hours since still not normal). I have been fine ever since after that 9th month when removed. Note: I was on prostate med (Tamsulosin) for years before I took Claritin and never had problem. When I started Claritin I continued to take it (tamsulosin) with no problem so the only thing we can assume is that the Claritin over the course of a year caused this since nothing else was introduced into my body.

However It seemed to bring down the flaking but never fully cleared it up, and the ithching still comes and goes which was there before treatment. Technically if your not washing ur hair at least twice a day it doesn't seem to work all that well. Another thing I have notice from using it is my hair has really brokin off and is somewhat falling out in the areas of treament.      Suggestion would be to use T-gel Sampoo along with the medication and then use a really good hair solution with good vitamines or orally take vitamine to help restore hair damage.Read More Read Less  "

The dermatologist I saw recommended Triamcinolone cream be applied daily for 2 weeks followed by CeraVe cream for 2 weeks. The Triamcinolone indeed caused the itchiness to recede however within a few days the itchiness did return with the discontinued use. A second round of application was recommended with the very same results. The Triamcinolone was only able to put the problem in check for a limited time. Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation. In short, and in my experience, the very expensive Triamcinolone was scantly better than the anti-itch products available over the counter.Read More Read Less  "

However, over the next few days my lips turned black and the skin-- ALL the skin-- began peeling away, until I was left with barely one layer on red/black lips that seeped blood constantly. They were so sensitive I could not eat, and even drinking through a straw was painful. I returned to the dermatologist who explained this was reaction not unusual and that I'd need to keep using it until my skin was ""adjusted"" to it. I, of course, declined. He did prescribe a steroidally based remedy which I applied several times daily so my lips returned to normal after another week. I regard this as a dangerous medication, however helpful it may be, that requires great care in usage.

My experience is when I applyed Synalar in a short period of time the symtims disapeared, In a week or two It would reappear and it was the same expearence for about two years. After a split with my wife, each time I made an application, the remidy would last longer. The last time I needed to use it, I applyed it and even when the sores dissapeared I kept on using it in a two or three day application for about a month.

I realize that this cream doesn’t work for me anymore just because my eczema is now spreading in places. I’ve never had it before, so I have chose to moderately withdraw from the steroid and heal my skin holistically
Side effects
Swelling
Stinging
Burning
Itching
Shivering
Fatigue
Flakiness
Of course, while stopping steroid cream, these common symptoms will happen first thing to do for mental health purposes and physical purposes, to find what comes and collects you well withdrawing from the steroid
Everything about eczema is trial and error so and just what you prefer
In hindsight, I wish I never started steroid cream. I wish my doctor prescribe some thing a little less overall, this cream works very well
But I do not recommend extensive use over long periods of time maybe 12 months Max

478,Elocon Topical,8/1/2009,13-18,Female,10 years or more,Patient,Skin Condition,5.0,5,5,5,"I am a 15 year old girl and my excema had gotten so bad that the dermatologist had been shocked by it.  It was open and weeping and there was blood drawing from beneath. I found it so painful I couldn't tollerate anything touching it. I was refered on to see the 'Top' dermatologist later that day who phoned my doctor.  She was shocked when he sent her my files through. You see I know exactly how well medication works and I can tell you if my skin has become immune to it within days / hours of trying it. I had said to my doctor that the hydrocortizone cream was not doing any good at all as all it was effectively doing was 'nothing' as my skin has become immune to it.  He replied excuse me I'm your doctor I think I would know if your skin has become immune to it.  So, when we were at the dermatologists' she asked me about it and I repeated what I had told my doctor days after starting the hydrocortizone. She asked my mum how he reacted and she told her. The dermatologist was really nice and asked to see a written account in a weeks time but I gave her my diary and she had seen all my accounts I had made within the past 8 months.  She came to lunch with us reading through my accounts and asking me more questions then she agreed with what I'd been saying all along and gave me ELOCON to try.  After 2 hours of starting it my skin was already closing up.  I was amazed. My mother even took photos every hour to show the 'COCKY' doctor.  Within a week it had miraculously improved.  Now I use Elocon 1 every day at the most and my skin looks pretty good.  I would recomend this to anyone who like me has been through hell and has been used like a test dummy for every medication you can name since they were weeks old. I hope if anyone does use it they achieve great results!Read More Read Less  "

These are the areas that tend to flair up the most. Sometimes it will flare up around the sides of my mouth, so I apply it there too. I do find that if I apply it to the inside of my ears everyday I get these pimples like from having to much grease on the skin. This problem doesn't seem to happen on my face. My doctor prescribed it for my ears but I tried it on my face one night because I couldn't take the itching anymore and it responded to the medication. HELPFUL TIP!!! The best way I have found to apply to the inside of the ear is to squeeze the ointment onto the tip of a cotton swab (Q-TIP) and slightly stick it inside the ear end turn it around so that it gets applied to all areas inside of the ear. MY doctor told me to never stop using this medicine. HOPE THIS INFORMATION IS HELPFUL TO SOMEONE.Read More Read Less  "

507,Ultravate Topical,2/7/2013,45-54,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Plaque Psoriasis,5.0,5,5,5,"Ultravate made a noticeable improvement in my psoriasis in just 2-days, and cleared small spots in 3-days.     The product does not smell. It has a consistency like a clear Vaseline Petroleum Jelly, so it is best to apply it during the day, because it will come off on your sheets at night. It does not stain fabric.     I have only tried it for a couple days on larger spots; spots larger than 2-inches wide and on thicker spots on my elbows, and it did not make a noticeable difference on them in that short a time. I did not try it longer on  the large spots, because it is uses up so much of my limited supply.    I have experienced great success treating large spots with the ultra-violet light machine at my dermatologist. You can even get a prescription to buy your own machine. The machine is like a stand-up 3-sided tanning booth. You go in in your underwear for 10-seconds, and over several weeks work your way up to a couple minutes. It cleared all my psoriasis completely, and I had it everywhere. Unfortunately, my psoriasis came back because I have several old spinal injuries that will not heal and which cause my psoriasis to flare. It is hard to find a dermatologist that uses the machine. You can buy a full size machine or a small desk-top model that you can just fit an arm or leg under. I am not sure exactly how the machine works. I think the machine emits a certain band of ultraviolet light that is concentrated. I know it is not the same light as sun-bathing, and I think the light is different than that from a tanning-booth; though it looks the same. You have to wear goggles, and build-up slowly or you can get a sunburn. I never had problem and I have very light and sensitive skin.Read More Read Less  "

I was not very impressed with its efficacy.  Applying it twice a day & wearing socks year-round was not pleasant for a woman in the professional field, but I was told that it was the best option for my condition.  The condition never cleared up & worsened each time that I missed an application.  I now have a new MD recommending other options- Vectical, Clobex and laser-light therapy.

Never had a prob with it and it really made my anxiety and quality of life better and much more able to partake in working at therapy.  So my psychiatrist changed locations to another state, so was referred to another practice.  I waited two months for an appt.  New Psych said I don't prescribe benzos so for your anxiety I'm going to give you this awesome alternative that works for many of my anxious patients.  Going to the pharmacy to pick it up there was some mixup at the pharmacy and the pharmacist had to call the dr.  The dr. revealed that she did send it over and that she's been sending over prescriptions for this medication all day for other patients with no problem.  A red flag went up then.  She is a cookie cutter doctor who prescribes a fashion medicine to whomever comes into her office.  Nevertheless I took this med for one week and each time i took it I felt weird.  Like all flushed, heart beating out of my chest and  didn't even touch my anxiety.  So i had some Klonopin left over so i took that and immediately felt better.  I went back to the dr and told her i've been duped into believing that this was a good med for anxiety when in fact it did nothing and she said i could up the dose.  That made things worse.  I flushed the remaining pills down the toilet and went back to her crying.  SHe saw how worked up i was and didn't know what to do.  Finally she broke down and gave me a prescription for Klonopin, but at a lower dose than what i was used to.  I was fine with that and life went on.  Not sure why this is such a wonderful med for anxiety.  I talked to other friends who said the same thing.  That docs are using it as a way to avoid benzos cuz the war on benzos. Lol.

I hate taking medications and have refused anything for my anxiety most of my life. This medication is a game changer. It relieves anxiety symptoms quickly and doesn’t cause me any side effects and is non-addicting. My son is prescribed it to help calm him before bed and for an anxiety prn and it’s also the only med he doesn’t refuse. I will not take anything addicting or that makes either of us “loopy”. Another perk is that is clears up any allergic reaction I get from working out in the yard. Read More Read Less

I have used this on 2 occasions where I had the rash on my arms.  It immediately stopped any spreading and it hastened the event from what is usually a 4 to 6 week battle to one that was about a week.  I have purchased many expensive treatments in the past and I have gotten steroid injections.  This is the only thing that I have tried that has actually worked.

Weirdest thing ever. No other daily psych meds. Dr prescribed me 1-4 pills up to 3 times a day as needed and told me it worked quickly so I could take it at a party or work thing if I got anxiety.

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person. I’ve only taken this drug 3 times (not even in a row) and will not be taking it again. Read More Read Less  "

Originally, the Vistaril was a low dose, so there wasn't any noticeable weight gain, but I also wasn't getting any relief from my symptoms.  On January 6, 2017, my pdoc increased my dosage to 50 mg. up to 3 times per day.  I am now getting relief from my symptoms, but I also notice the scale creeping upwards.  This upsets and frustrates me becsuse since August 1, 2016, I have worked hard to lose 30 pounds and I'm petrified of that slipping away.  I just don't know what to do.  I'm petrified of gaining weight, but yet, the benefits of Vistaril have been great. I don't see my pdoc until February 15th.

The burn had healed well, but then he developed shingles in the affected area.  We live in a remote area and had already made the trip to town for diagnosis.  Whatever was prescribed was not helping our son at all.  It was desperation that made me grab the Topsyn that had worked so well on our other son's poison ivy outbreak.  Not only did our young son find immediate relief, the shingles were gone within a few days and NEVER returned.  I am aware of two other instances in which the same results were achieved on cases of shingles.  One case was my dad, who had suffered with the condition for over a year before I learned he had it.  I insisted that he use the Topsyn.  He was so glad he did.  The other instance was the son of a good friend.  This young man had shingles appear on his face shortly before he was scheduled for his Senior graduation pictures to be taken.  They were desperate, used the Topsyn, had the rash disappear, and it never returned.  I have mentioned this to various doctors through the years, but have always been the recipient of a rather disinterested response.  Whatever can be done to promote this use of Topsyn would be appreciated by so many sufferers of Shingles.  Please get the word out!Read More Read Less  "

I always felt that my anal itching was growing worse because of the continued scratching I just could not avoid because of the intense itching, so I knew I needed to do something to relieve the itching.     A few hours upon applying this hydrocortisone to my anus, the itching lessened by around 95%. There would still be occasional tinges of itchiness, but not enough to cause me to scratch.     I've continued to use the product for a week now, with no side effects. My doctor has told me to try stopping the medication to check if the itching would recur, but I'm actually hesitant to stop using the product because I'm afraid the itching will return.     I will post an update when possible.Read More Read Less  "

I couldn’t get it under control. I couldn’t sleep at night, overthinking.  I told my doctor about it and that I didn’t want anything for depression.  I am not depressed. I enjoy life and I have a lot of energy. I just get overwhelmed.  She prescribed this medication and it works wonders. She said I can take it twice a day but I only take it at night before bed.

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days. Any more than that and I can't keep my eyes open, but everyone's tolerance level is different. 50mg is perfect for me to help me get to sleep. Read More Read Less  "
723,Hydroxyzine Pamoate Oral,1/14/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Inducing of a Relaxed Easy State,5.0,5,5,5,"So, like many others here I’ve suffered from PTSD, and mild depression. I also have panic attacks and feelings at times of negative thoughts and feelings of being unsafe. I talked with my psychiatrist, and I even suggested a Benzo, she immediately dismissed it. She said told me the last thing she wanted to give any medication starting off that could have major side effects. So she prescribed me this. I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water. Plus I’ve gotten my appetite back. Hope this helps. Read More Read Less  "
724,Hydroxyzine Pamoate Oral,12/6/2022,55-64,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Other,2.0,1,4,1,Prescribed this for insomnia and it does NOTHING. I still wake up about every hour and then it takes about another hour to get back to sleep after tossing and turning. I even take 2 of the 50 mgs. and still NOTHING.

One dose lasts all night and has a strong anxiolytic effect the next day and even into the following night.  As a result, I only have to take one dose every 2-3 days.  One apparent side effect that concerns me is that after taking a 50mg dose at bedtime, I definitely feel agitated for hours the following morning after getting out of bed.  I wonder if anyone else has noticed this."

It's definitely something to take the edge off for me, until I can find new medication to treat the anxiety much more.

I'd recommend for mild anxiety."

Withdrawal from clonazepam has been brutal.  Anxiety is off the charts, haven't slept more than an hour here and there.  Doctors are idiots for prescribing this for severe anxiety and insomnia.

Each one i told them that this med doesn't work for my anxiety.  It doesn't even touch it.  Finally I got a psychiatrist that i trusted and told him that and please don't give this to me for anxiety.  He explained that it works for mild anxiety, not the extreme anxiety i experience.  He had no problem prescribing 1 mg of Klonopin 2 times per day.  I came back a month later and I told him how much different it made in my life.  I am not addicted, but feel really    functional again.  His final words on Visteral was "" I never prescribe that in my practice.  It is not a psychotropic med and the only way he'd ever prescribe it was for itching and skin rash.  He also told me that he was disappointed that so many dr's prescribe this and I swear the minute i take Klonopin I feel better. No anxiety. No matter what happens or what conflicts i have i can rely on Klonopin to bring me back to my baseline! BOOOOO Hydroxyzine! Read More Read Less  "

I have moderately-intense anxiety and this medication quiets things down to a manageable volume level. It is safe, non-habit forming, and fast acting. Side effects are mostly noticeable only when I go looking for them, but they are minor. I've been on the entire spectrum of psychotropic medication, and trust me, this one is worth a shot."
735,Hydroxyzine Pamoate Oral,6/13/2021,19-24,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Anxious,3.7,3,5,3,I have been suffering do to depersonalization and my anxiety keeping me up all night. I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me. Or I might only take half a pill. Overall it does help with anxiety though. Just weird side effects Read More Read Less

I am on .25mg doses for my attacks which when I was younger would put me right out to sleep and make me feel well rested and tired groggy but now that Iâ??m 20 and older the effects have somewhat changed on me. Now Iâ??m having issues with heart pains stomach pains sleeplessness irritability and I even started taking two to see if upping the does might help and it seemed to make it worse even tho the first two times seemed to help now Iâ??m awake all night and canâ??t sleep. Not to mention it makes you feel like a living emotionless robot I donâ??t feel like I care anymore or have a reason on this drug like no motivation anymore and canâ??t seem to find my way almost like being continuously confused.

My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes. It relaxes me and makes me have a sense of well-being for the rest of the day. It does make me feel drowsy too, but not terribly so."

A soak in an oatmeal bath would help for as long as I was in the water and for maybe an hour or so after.

As for nausea, this was nowhere near as effective as Phenergan (promethazine) but it had noticeable anti emetic effects that were clouded by drowsiness. 
I thought these were capsule only. I got tablets which compared to the faster acting capsules were awful tasting and hard to cut. Ask for the capsules. 
I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone. I'm on Valium 10mg so they do nothing for my anxiety/panic but they are a nice way to fall asleep. Read More Read Less  "

Being referred to an excellent pulmonologist by my internist at that point was certainly of great importance to finally being diagnosed w/this disease and for my course of treatment.

It does make me a bit lightheaded and really tired but it helps. I have had no other side effects from the medication then sleepiness, but it has hydrocodone in it to make you sleep. I have no hangover or anything while taking this medication. I highly recomend it. But then FDA has taken it off the market.   I don't know why the FDA took this medication off the market.  They say that it wasn't effetive. This was the only medication that I could take to help with my bronchitis. I have an allegery to codeine but hydrocodone does not bother me unless I use it more then 2 weeks. Now the only drugs that are avaliable are Tussionex or Robatussin AC.

I did experience quick drowsiness shortly after taking it, and would feel a bit strange and dizzy, but I would make sure to take it right before retiring for the night and it wasn't a problem.

Seems to work well, much like Claritin or Zyrtec.  The dose is small (based on her weight) and usually lasts about 6-8 hours.  Even with the 'flavored' type from the pharmacy, my kid hates the taste.  Hence, the 4-stars;  I always get the 'whine' when giving it.  It has not always done the job and have required something else or a trip back to the doctor a couple of times.  This is not necessarily because it is not so effective.  More, it may be the certain condition or the level of sickness my child is experiencing.  All in all, its a good medicine and I would recommend.      Read More Read Less  "

I had tried almost every SSRI, SNRI, etc Finally I met a psychiatrist who truly listened to me and actually recommended this medication which most nowadays do not. as in last 3 years I’ve had 6 surgeries due to pelvic floor dysfunction and am just so tense both physically and mentally to where I now have ileostomy as nothing wants to leave my body. Since I have started this my stomach muscles have relaxed I’m able to function thru an entire day work full time and be the father and husband I strive to be. It’s truly been a life saver in multiple ways and I understand the risks as well but the benefits far outweigh the cons and I’m grateful.

Long story short. I am plagued by panic attacks since hitting menopause 4 years ago.
 I have tried 7 different types of antidepressants.
I’m on hormone replacement therapy.
I was started on 2 mga of Xanax 4 years ago and came off it 13 weeks ago due to visual hallucinations and terrible fatigue also waves of anxiety.

I have tried therapy everything that I have been told to do and I am so unwell now with debilitating anxiety and panic.
I do not have depression.

I am under a psychiatrist but after 4 years with him I haven’t got better.
My GP who is brilliant has suggested low dose of diazepam.
I feel a failure if I try this and so afraid of medication now.
But I can’t live like this every day.
3 times I have been in emergency due to panic attacks and the dreadful physical symptoms.

I guess I just need reassurance as what I should do and will I be ok taking them.Read More Read Less  "
1169,Valium Oral,8/4/2022,35-44,Female,,Patient,Panic Disorder,4.3,4,5,4,"I've been on benzodiazepine medications since 2004 when I went through a horrible bout of anxiety and could barely leave home.  I've had an anxiety disorder my entire life and have had panic attacks since I was 12.  I've been taking Valium 5 mg for about 5 years now but I'm now tapering off it because I'm having trouble accessing the medication and don't want to wind up in the ER with benzo withdrawal, which has happened to me before.  It angers me that a person with true anxiety and PTSD like myself who doesn't even drink alcohol is being treated like a drug addict for the mere crime of needing my long-term medication by my ""new"" psych nurse practitioner.  Healthcare providers today care too much about their potential financial liability and nothing about the suffering of their patients.  I am being forced to pay for urine drug screens out of pocket (yesterday I paid for one at $135, which I cannot afford) to ensure I'm not abusing my medication.  Honey, if I was an addict I'd be on skid row by now as I've been on benzos for 18 years, yet I manage somehow to hold down a good job with good insurance. My only crime is living in an area with no healthcare providers.  But, I digress. Valium is a good drug and has kept my panic disorder at bay. It does make me very tired during the day so I think that cutting down and getting off it will be a good thing for me. Hopefully I can keep my anxiety under control with ""natural supplements."" Wish me luck.Read More Read Less  "

1171,Valium Oral,1/6/2022,45-54,Male,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Anxious,5.0,5,5,5,"I have basically situational exacerbated Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  Translation: My A-type personality makes me worry a lot more than the average person and I'm not as well 'equipped' mentally to deal with unusually high-anxiety life events/situations than most people to the point it disrupts my ability to get through a day productively sometimes.

For most of my like I just 'sucked it up' until I found out in my 30's that my Mom had GAD (which until then I didn't even know I had GAD) and starting putting the pieces of the puzzle together as to why I so often feel anxious and fear and foreboding of bad events to come in the future.  I exhaustively research anything and everything.  The pharma profile (so to speak) of Valium fit my condition (and low and behold that's what my Mom was taking off and on all these years I didn't know.)  The psychiatrist I went to agreed but we both agreed that regular physical exercise and Vitamin D supplements were also key (I live in the Northwest and get Seasonal Affective Disorder in the Winter of course also.)

I'm 190 lbs male.  I take it off and on, usually for a 1-3 day stint every 6-9 days. If I haven't taken any for a week or more, 5 mg once or twice a day is enough to take the anxious/panicky edge off and let me work productively throughout the day.  Otherwise it takes 10mg if I've take it in the last 5-6 days.  The actual therapeutic effect (that you feel) is short-lived (maybe 4-6 hours at best) but the metabolites have a much longer half-life (3-4 days or in that vicinity) than the other popular benzodiazepines, namely the popular Xanax.  This is mostly a good thing and a bit of a bad thing.  It's bad due to the aforementioned reason in that if you take it frequently, it contributes to a tolerance (which plateaus) but so is the same as the other benzos.

The more important good thing about it is that unless you are taking high doses for a very long time (like 20mg total a day or more for a month or more every day), valium is WAY easier to stop taking as the long half life of the metabolites makes the withdrawal period stretch out much longer than say Xanax.  Depending on your dosing regimen you might feel a varying degree of withdrawal which is easily avoided by slowly tapering off on your dosage but if you unexpectedly don't have access to your medication for 2 or 3 days, if you're a moderate or infrequent user, you are MUCH better off than if you were taking Xanax or Ativan.  Xanax is frankly DANGEROUS to intentionally or unintentionally abruptly discontinue after consistent use.  

Xanax also doesn't have the same muscle relaxant properties as Valium but it is better suited to combat SEVERE and SUDDEN full blown PANIC attacks than Valium (but not by much in my opinion as Valium kicks in, in about the same time but just not as suddenly strong as Xanax.)

Many doctors will avoid prescribing benzos like the plague and rightfully so because if the patient doesn't understand about things like half-life and withdrawal, tolerance and dependence, these things can easily creep into the patient's life and as a result benzos in general have gotten a very bad wrap (like opioids and overuse of antibiotics) in recent years.  Valium is also considered sort of the 'old school' benzo and for some reason I think a lot of doctors don't put it on their radar all together when considering prescriptions (except for muscle spasms.) 

Based on my personal experience and reading my opinion is that for anxiety disorder, PTSD, and moderate panic attacks, this is by far the best choice over the other benzos as long as you try to limit your intake to just the minimum of what you need to feel ""normal"" and productive not ""sedated"" and lethargic.  I like that it doesn't affect my ability to work a fairly mentally intense job (software development.)  Note though there have been studies that long-term use can cause some cognitive decline but I believe that is for a years of constant use and more than 10mg a daRead More Read Less  "

I began having issues breathing and my doctor said I was  hyperventilating. I was prescribed valium 5 mg daily and it was a major relief. Sadly, it's apparent that I suffer from PTSD and I've remained on the valium. If it wasn't for this medication, I truly would be in the ER way too often. It allows me to function with NO side effects. The only PROBLEM, is that when attempting to change physicians, no other physician will prescribe it. How on earth can this be. It saved me and they can easily check to see how many I get and how often I get them, so it's easy to see that nothing has changed all these years.  It's a shame that these doctors try to make it seem that you have an addiction. Severe anxiety, PTSD , none of these are a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If some people doesn't know what IBS-D is it's Irritable Bowel Syndrome with super watery diarrhea! Sorry for being so blunt! That Dr gave me 2 RX'S for Valium 1 mg taken 3 times a day for 5 days. Each RX was the same. He told me if the diarrhea stopped within the first RX to not fill the other RX and I told him okay. It didn't stop so I filled the other RX and within 2 days, the watery diarrhea totally stopped! I have been having another attack of my IBS-D for over a month now! I have gone to the ER where I live 2 times and in another town and no one would help me! I finally got in with my Dr a few days ago and he said the Valium would be okay but he rather try me on a new drug called Viberzi! This new med has been nothing but solid hell. I am going to call my Dr in the morning and tell him to get me on the Valium instead. It does work for so many things. I also have taken Valium when I have had to have a MRI because I have a bad anxiety disorder and I can't stand to be in that little tunnel. Just freaks me out. Why won't Dr's listen to us anymore? This Viberzi that he put me on is also what they call a Controlled Substance and I can't stand the way it makes me feel. Plus it's making me get fluid retention super bad. I had no problems when taking the Valium for that short time and I'm going to get back on it to get this stopped. I highly recommend Valium for a lot of reasons.

Months of antibiotics and no relief what so ever i had to even go on disability because it was too painful to walk long distances. Finally my urologist sent me to a pelvic floor specialist who said it wasnt my prostate but was the muscles of pelvic floor. He told me stress or physical trauma can cause you to tighten your pelvic floor muscles and they get all bound up and spasm causing crazy symptoms. It can cause painful urination, pelvic pain, testicle pain etc.. i honestly thought the guy was nuts and there was no way so muscle strain could be causing all this. He basically showed me some stretching techniques, put my on rectal valium suppository to loosen the tension and gave me some norco for a week so that the pain was reduced and i could relax.

Have tried several SSRIâ??s with some success, but prefer valium because it works with almost no side effects. While on Valium, after eating a meal, I may doze off for 20 or so minutes. Combination of the meal and the Valium. When taking, usually itâ??s 5mg at bedtime. Sleep better, longer, with fewer disturbing dreams. May take a 2nd 5mg during really anxious days (i.e. when packing for a trip). Will take for a couple of weeks while traveling, and no problem stopping except maybe a day of mild depression. Doesnâ??t conflict with my before-supper 2 glasses of wine, except when on Valium the size of those glasses may be smaller (more relaxed to begin with).

You can imagine how I felt I would never feel ok ever again as each medication failed to work after months of trying. The doctors in the uk told me there was nothing else they could try, and I was in a very dark place. I contacted another doctor who said Clonipromine was their last ditch attempt at helping me (not a great way of saying it but oh well). Within the first week I felt like a new person. I actually feel quite emotional writing this. My panic attacks are gone, my racing thoughts and spiralling are basically over. I can just let them go and that’s that! I used to not be able to be alone with my own thoughts because I would have a panic attack from them. I was constantly listening to podcasts or having Netflix on so my brain could be sidetracked from causing me distress. This drug saved my life. I feel more and more like myself each day.

1204,Clomipramine Oral,5/17/2017,35-44,,1 to 6 months,Patient,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,1.0,1,1,1,I have bipolar and OCD.  As soon as I started this medicine i went into hypomania. I will go for a couple days not being able to sleep then ill sleep for a couple days in a row.  It has been a nightmare. Cycling between mania and depression every other day. Not to mention the constant twitching in my legs and feet that i didn't have before i started this medicine

Doctor just raised dose to 75mg a week ago- had reaction with fast heartbeat, crazy loud buzzing in ears, muscle pain; along with ongoing side effects of dry mouth, flushing, sore throat and anorexia. This med did not help alleviate OCD for me."
1206,Clomipramine Oral,4/4/2017,45-54,,10 years or more,Patient,Anxious,4.7,5,5,4,"Suffering from invasive thoughts, anxiety, panic.It works for me. This is the only drug that gives me relief. This drug has harsh side effects. You definitely need to build it up slowly and reduce slowly when coming off. Some people are unfortunate and react harshly to this drug so consider that it may affect you too but definitely worth trying as for many people, it really works. "

I've now been on this for a year at 300mg.  It's worked better for me than any SRI's.  It took away about 90% and the rest I can manage.  This has been a wonderful drug for me.  I have side effects (very dry mouth and constipation), but the results are worth it to me."
1208,Clomipramine Oral,3/18/2016,25-34,,1 to 6 months,Patient,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,5.0,5,5,5,"This drug has been a life saver for me. I was in a very dark place with severe OCD and anxiety. I'd tried numerous other medications that didn't work and I had lost hope of getting better. Within 4 weeks of taking clomipramine I saw improvements. It's amazing. I really didn't think anything was going to help me but this drug proved me wrong. The only downside is the side effects, but I'd much rather tolerate them than the hell I was going through. Dry mouth, occasional shaking, weak and sore muscles (arms and legs), nausea. Read More Read Less  "

I have taken this drug for 5 years, sometimes routinely each day, much more often only at need, and always at modest doses (3.75 to 11.25 mg 1 time per day is typical), I do not currently take it every day.  I have never become addicted, and I have never needed increased dose to produce the same effect. This is a miracle drug for me.  It reduces both anxiety and its concomitant depression.  At the higher dose, taken regularly, it does exacerbate my essential tremor slightly, slightly impacts my balance, and may very mildly impact my cognition.  For those reasons I do not take it continuously.  These side effects disappear when I discontinue use.  In 40 years of treatment I have taken almost every anti-depressant, with and without adjunctive meds.  None has ever been effective, and all have had hard-to-bear side effects.  Everyone has different reactions to meds, and everyone has different propensity for addiction.  Talk to your doctor if you have a similar profile.Read More Read Less  "

I take it with Mitazaprin for depression and anxiety. I thought I was going to go crazy as they tried out different meds on me, like, Xanax, Librium and valium to name a few. They started me on this at a low dose and gradually increased it until ALL my anxiety is GONE. Like the one reviewer said, like magic. I am thankful to the Lord everyday for it.

After a BAD experience with both Xanax and Klonopin (neither did a thing for me and Xanax made things worse) I asked to try this drug.  Within 2 weeks, TWO YEARS of high anxiety (PTSD levels) and insomnia had melted away.  NEVER any desire to up my dosage from 15mg due to the long half-life, and in fact after a year on it I've reduced my dosage to 3.75mg nightly.

No antidepressant or combination of medications significantly impacted these conditions until my psychiatrist (with whom I had already worked for over 3 years in a 40-yr history of treatment and meds trials) prescribed Tranxene 7.5 mg 3x/day for unusually extreme situational anxiety. We tried non-generic Tranxene because it's 1 of only 2 anxiolytics without corn (I'm corn intolerant).  It worked within days to resolve the situational anxiety and has significantly reduced my long-term GAD and depression.  I have taken 3.25 to 10.75 mg 1 to 3x/day depending on my psychological status for more than 2 years.  I have never needed to increase the original dosage, and most frequently take 7.5 mg 2x/day.  I experience very mild increases in essential tremors and word-finding at the higher/more frequent dose, so I work to keep the dose low.  Fortunately my insurer (FedBlue) covers the Rx (quoted at $450/mo sans insurance).  Tranxene is a miracle for me; my doctor says the experience has made him reconsider his attitude about the early benzodiazepenes. Read More Read Less  "

I remember my mom and I laughing a lot before I was taken into pre-op. She later told me the things I was saying, and we laughed again. For my second surgery, no one's allowed in the pre-anesthesia area for neurosurgery that isn't a surgeon, neurologist, anesthesiologist, nurse anesthestician or anesthestician assistant. I was terrified knowing that my brain was set to be forever altered, and I wasn't crying very long when the nurse aesthetician came to my bed and put a higher dose of Versed than I'd had previously. I remember feeling profoundly calm and relaxed, and nothing else after that. I can't imagine this outside of a hospital setting, nor would I want to. I know it's used in the ER to brings epileptics out of status, and when I've had it for that, it calms me down and stops the seizure immediately.

We tried so many anti anxity drugs before hand with no effect. Without her having this medication before hand we never would have been able to get her into the hospital. She had 25 mg orally before going in. It made her silly for a few minutes and we carried her in directly to the operating room. She had no memory of going into the hospital. When she got home she had no after effects. She was just as she was before hand. This medication made this trip to the hospital a breeze. I would recommend talking with your doctor before the procedure about having this given to you especially  if you or your child has a severe anxity issue. Read More Read Less

It was somewhat difficult to administer to him (he has special needs which includes a mouth sensitivity where he will not let anyone willingly into his mouth). He did fine once the medicine kicked in, however upon coming out of it experienced extreme agitation, aggression, and rage. He was very violent and it took myself and his grandmother hours of holding him down for it to pass. He was still unable to walk properly for atleast three hours after leaving the dental office (although he was insistent that he could) and we again were forced to physically hold him so he would not injure himself by crashing into walls and the floor. It was a very scary experience for myself as a parent and can only imagine how frustrating and confusing it must have been for him.Read More Read Less  "

Stomach ache and headache.  We wound up taking her to the ER for several hours while she was observed for further complications and upon checkout we were told not to have her take versed again.

I took him to an environmental medicine dr. who did a thorough medical history and said he has seen so many similar cases of this after Versed use.  His treatment involved some detoxing to hopefully rid the lingering effects from his system. He is now feeling much better, and unfortunately, he has a condition that will require future surgeries.

During that time I developed a whole host of gastrointestinal issues stemming from chronic constipation.  My anxiety and OCD were almost non-existent and after this long I decided to try life without this medication.       The withdrawal was hard.  Muscle twitches, restlessness, and crying at Hallmark commercials.  After a month they went away.  What also went away???  My horrible, chronic, constipation!  I went from pooping three times a week, passing out on occasion whilst attempting, to going twice a day!  Life is better off the med.       Something to note, when combined with Amitiza my seizure threshold was lowered enough to trigger a 10 minute grand mal seizure.  I do not have epilepsy, or any other seizure disorder, and have been released by the neurologist.  Apparently both Amitiza and Anafranil are both cleared by the liver and the Anafranil level in my blood was so high after adding the Amitiza (a med used to combat chronic constipation) that it caused me to have a seizure.Read More Read Less  "

I can barely get my body to function in any way to get up and move around. I often woke up feeling as though I had an extremely bad hangover. after taking it for several months I started to notice how bad I was shaking and the constant numbness in my hands. After taking it for sometime the shaking became less severe, but it never went away. It was often embarrassing to look as though I was even more nervous than I was, since my hands were trembling half the time. I would wake up in the morning and barely be able to pick up and hold anything, constantly dropping everything. After some time my doctor finally realized that my heart condition was worsening on this medication. I was also on heart medication at this time, actually I was onto at the time trying to remedy the situation. after I stop taking this medication my heart problems decreased, they're still there but I only need one medication out of control for the most part. I kept having to have my dosage of because after three or four months on each dosage it's effects started to decrease.

I have tried Lexapro, Zoloft, and Cymbalta, each of which had some effect on my issues but were ultimately outweighed by unwanted side effects. ELAVIL stood out because the initial side effects were minimal, and I did experience a reduction in pain.  After a few months, however, the weight gain was noticeable and significant. I have gained about 25-30 lbs (with no signs of stopping), which on a small-framed person is a lot, especially the breast enlargement. I am 5'3"" and healthy-looking at 140 lbs. I already have large breasts, normally a D cup, and on Elavil, they are back to how big they were when I was nursing (DD,E).  My anxiety is only minimally reduced, and I have some forgetfulness and although my pain (knees, leg, back) is improved, it is not enough to eliminate needing supplemental pain medication. I had already decided to wean off the drug, when I went on a road trip and forgot the meds (accidentally on purpose?). The on call doc refused to call in a lower dose for me, so now I am on day three of coming off 75 mg cold turkey. It is predictably unpleasant:  I am anxious, weepy, have difficulty sleeping, and the pain is returning. On day two was nauseous to the point of vomiting, and my appetite is significantly reduced. On Elavil I experienced a marked urge to eat sugary things, which is not typical for me. I also felt a dampening of all emotions, both good and bad, and I just dont feel like myself.

Almost lost everything because of the migraines. I had seen 4 Dr's and they all accused me of seeking painkillers. I had a constant throbbing in my head. 24/7. And like clock work it would spike to a migraine. I was taking OTC meds. Around 80 pills a day. Just to keep it barrable. The migraines would get so bad I contemplated suicide. I had two scans done. Nothing. I finally went to Renown Neurology in Reno, NV. My Dr there finally believed me. She put me on Elivil. I have good days which are far more often than bad. On bad days I take my rescue med (Zomig). Elivil has not only saved my life (along with my Dr) but it gave me my life back. There are some side affects. Like weight gain. Which is fine with me because I lost 32 pounds while dealing with such intense pain I had zero appetite. And dry mouth. I wake up in the middle of the night and my mouth is so dry my tongue is literally stuck to the roof of my mouth. Nothing a drink of water won't fix. Also I dream allot more at night.

I was put on lorazepam about 17 years ago. It made me grumpy after awhile and I couldn’t sleep. My Dr suggested instead of winging off because my issues make my life unbearable medication free.

If you’re actually looking for a medication to help you and not one that’s going to make you “high” or sleepy after you take it then groggy and then grumpy I suggest this medication..

I take it just before going to bed. I've been skipping it every other day for about 3 weeks, due to being close to running out of them. My mail order pharmacy screwed up the newest prescription date my doctor called in to them early November, and they wouldn't release them to me. I only now (12/30/14) appear to have finally got that issue cleared up. Anyway, it appears that me missing taking this every day has caused me to relapse into a depressive state now and again. Anxiety, fear of death, and crying.    Can just taking this drug for every other day (rather than daily as I'm supposed to) for 3  weeks cause a relapse such as this? I wouldn't have believed it, but something is sure going on. I have about enough pills left to last me 2 weeks (if taken every day). Hopefully the pharmacy will send the new ones before them.

The Prozac was ""over-stimulating"" and discontinued.  I remained on the Doxepin and my anxiety decreased and my mood significantly improved.  Through the years I have had trials with the newer drugs (SSRI) and the side effects were awful.  Doxepin is the only one in the TCA class that works for me.

Daily: dry mouth, sleep disturbances; both nightmares, insomnia and drowsiness, (yes those often contradict themselves), extreme   heartburn if taken and immediately lay down, blurred vision,   slowed speech, appearance of intoxication.

Before treatment my blood pressure would rapidly drop if upright, all the way down to 35/0 (yes I turned fun shades of blue and grey, stayed conscious but very easily confused and very painful, had memory trouble for the 6 months before they found the problem and started treatment along with the first year on medication).  I was on Acebutolol for about 10 years but still was bedridden for a good portion of each year.  200mg twice a day.    When my 3 children were young they brought home colds and flus fairly often and each time I caught one from them the medicine couldn't keep up with me and I would be in bed with rapidly dropping blood pressure for weeks or months on end.    After about 10 years I switched to Midodrine for 5 years with extremely mixed results (terrible side effects, but most of the time my blood pressure was stable) before the side effects were just too much to bear and I switched back.    Now that there's a flu vaccine protocol for people who are allergic to eggs, I'm able to take the shot each year and my children are in high school and no longer spread bugs to me on a regular basis.  I'm still not employed but I'm able to be on a regular schedule for short volunteer shifts behind a desk at our local food pantry, drive whenever I planned on it, attend holidays, etc and support my kids extra curriculars (including rigorous schedules at professional theatres, long hours but I mostly sit and knit while they work, then rest up for weeks afterwards from exhaustion!).. if I don't have a migraine or sinus infection :)    Unfortunately I have to stop taking it now because I developed a latex allergy from rubber stamping for years while I was bedridden and need to be able to take an epipen with full effect.

I ended up in hospital due to tremors, hallucinations, and psychosis.They told to to slowly try to ween myself off alcohol by cutting down slowly but that didn’t work for me so I went to the doctors they prescribed me with a 7 day Librium taper and I can honestly say I was shocked at how quickly the results, worked my appetite was back my shakes subsided massively I was able to sleep and feel like myself again

1393,Librium Oral,10/14/2015,35-44,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Symptoms from Alcohol Withdrawal,4.7,5,5,4,"I have been to 2 rehab facilities, and 2 ER visits for my alcoholism. This last visit to the ER was for pancreatitis. I was in for a week, and was prescribed Librium for 2 weeks, with a slow taper towards the end. It did what it was meant to do. Cut down anxiety, lessened cravings, and gave my body time to recover. What some people on here don't understand, is it isn't a drug to stop us alcoholics from ""wanting"" or ""craving"" alcohol. That is up to us individually to do. There isn't a miracle drug out there that will stop us from thinking the way we think. It's a constant battle to stay sober for many of us. Even though I am an Atheist, I still attend AA meeting so that people of like minds can help give me the tools to stay sober. It's just as much mental, as it is anything else. Librium helped me once I fell off the wagon, and had to go to the hospital when my pancreas swelled 4 times the size it is, but I took my last pill two days ago, and with the tools I learned in rehab, and the support of family and friends, I haven't had one craving. We alcoholics will never stop being alcoholics. The ""Just one."" mentality doesn't work for us. If you want to be sober, there is support and understanding out there, but it won't come in a pill form. This pill did what it needed to do. Cut down on my shakes (as an alcoholic, most of us think that if we have a couple of drinks to get rid of the shakes, we will be fine, but when does it ever stop at ""Just a couple.""?) I take Citalopram, Trazadone, Hydroxazine, Zofran, and formerly Librium. Some to battle depression (also a cause/side effect of alcohol), but nothing will stop the cravings except my own mind. So, stay strong. Keep the path, and don't ""rely"" on medicine to fix you. Work on fixing yourself.Read More Read Less  "

1447,Diazepam Oral,7/22/2023,25-34,Male,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Other,4.3,4,5,4,"C-PTSD: Diazepam Taper: I have taken Benzos for 7+ years. I am Clonaz/Diazepam. (4Mg Clonaze to 60mg Diaze)
I switched to Diazepam because of it's long half-life. I am trying to stop/reduce to at least 40mg. I want to stop completely.
It is more than hard. It takes some serious mental strength. Especially when everyone around does not understand. Thankfully I have a doctor who knows how dangerous Benzo W/D's can be... He's helping me by prescribing five 10mg and five 2mg = 60mg. He's expecting it to take years.
Even 1mg reductions had me craving for more after 5 days at 59Mg.
I had to buy a pill splitter. To split the 2mgs into even 1/4rs.
I previously tried to reduce by having twelve, 5 Mg tablets daily. Reducing by 2.5mg every 2-3 weeks. (That did not work. The combination of 10% variability of potency with generic drugs + 12 tablets made it a roller coaster.) Five, 10 Mg tablets + five, 2 Mg tablets daily is the same dose. It is much smoother because 10% of 10mg is 1mg. X5= A deviation of 5Mg in a 50mg dose. Compared to 10% of twelve 5mg, 0.5Mg X 12= A possible 6mg Dose difference while taking 60mg. Sometimes it was like I was taking eleven 5mg tablets, and having serous W/D's. Taking what should be 60mg. There is a difference in generic doses. I've been on them so long. I asked my Dr. he said, I am one of his patients who has taken Benzo's for the longest time. Probably why reducing my a mere 1mg I find uncomfortable. It's going to be a slow taper. Thank goodness my Dr. is experienced and not rushing me. In fact he's telling me to slow down, and put less pressure on myself.
I take APO-Diazepam. It's the only generic available where I live. I prefer PMS. (brand)Read More Read Less  "

1449,Diazepam Oral,4/23/2023,25-34,Male,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Other,4.0,3,5,4,"I experience PTSD symptoms. (I'm Diagnosed) I was taking Clonazepam T.I.D. for 6 years, but it's effect's dropped-off rapidly. I kept a timer to take a dose every 8 Hours. If I forgot a dose, within hours I went into withdrawal.

I am young 30's, slim/ healthy BMI, not much body fat, But a healthy weight. For my height. 5'11/12"". 125-135 Lbs depending on holiday season! Mostly muscle, I'm not weak. Once I was 110Lbs... Yikes! I looked like a ghoul.

I lowered my Clonazepam from 4Mg to 3Mg... That was hellish. Asked my doctor to switch me to Diazepam. Because of the longer half-life/ reduced withdrawals. Now I take 20mg, 10mg and 30mg at night. (60mg Diazepam daily) Starting with 30Mg Diazepam 1.5mg Clonazepam for a month. Then 60mg Diazepam. Easy transition.

Instead of 1.5mg/1mg/1.5mg. (4mg) Self tapered to 3mg...1.25mg, 0.5mg, 1.25mg (Clonazepam)

Diazepam's major effects are shorter acting than Clonazepam. 5-7 Hours V.S. 6-9 Hours for me.
But Diazepam wavers down over 12+ hours. More like 3 days. Clonazepam, for me... felt like it was ""gone"" in 24 hours. Though it was in my system. I didn't feel it after a day.

Diazepam, doesn't drop like a rock after 10 hours, and hit me with crippling withdrawals.
I CAN forget a dose, or take one if I remember. Without waiting over an hour for withdrawal relief.

Not for the elderly or those who metabolize differently. It seems my metabolism is fast. Diazepam is a life saver, compared to Clonazepam. Faster acting, longer acting, NO DEPRESSION.
It does make you drowsier. I can see why 60Mg is the max dose for anxiety. I should not drive any heavy equipment!

Diazepam, the 2nd medically approved Benzo. Best for tapering. Not too potent. Comes in small doses, 2mg. (Split that into 1/4rs for reduction.) A wide range of effects/receptor action, to help transfer's from other Benzo's.

I don't think I could function without it. I am still terrorized by nightmares and hyper-vigilance. 10+ years after the major traumatic event.

Diazepam > Clonazepam and other Benzo's I've tried. (Lorazepam, Alprazolam, Oxaxepam Clonazepam and Diazepam)

Grey-market Benzos. False presses. Grey market Alprazolam/lorazepam/Benzo analogues. Thienotriazolodiazepine's [Etizolam]...(possible opiates) STAY AWAY!!! I had I had a friend O.D/./die from ""Percocet"" filled with fentanyl.

Long term, for sleep/anxiety/Hyper-vigilance/insomnia/flashbacks/night terrors. Diazepam is my drug of choice. It's not perfect. But it's better than over 6 other medication's/combinations I've tried.

Please, don't start taking Benzodiazepine's until you have exhausted all options. I'm physically/mentally addicted. It's just as bad as heroin. Except you can die from Benzo W/D... It's worse than Alcohol and Delirium Tremens. Opiate W/D death's are rare/ Except for synthetic opiates like Methadone. The only positive is routine dosing. Making it seem less ""addictive.""

I've been an alcoholic. Dying in bed for 3 days, sweating and twitching. (I had to show my doctor, I quit booze, before he would prescribe benzos) I've only taken Tylenol 3's... After the dentist.
But I know GABA W/D can kill. Where as Opiate's are much less likely to cause fatal effects, during W/D.

I wish ""Valium"" wasn't so taboo. I would have been taking it sooner. In a lower dose.
But my Dr. prescribes Clonazepam as the major benzo. We started @ 2Mg then after a month to 3mg. Then 4mg. He even considered 5Mg, I said: no way.

I've tried, SSRI's/SNRI's, TCA's like Amitriptyline. Anti-psychotics like Risperidone. (Risperidone made me want to commit suicide.) Offered Trazodone repeatedly. I won't take any anti-psychotics after Risperidone... But I am already hooked on GABA (Positive allosteric modulators.)... I'm not messing with my brain, anymore than possible.

Diazepam is the best for me... If you are elderly or have a slower metabolism/Higher BMI. Maybe ask about Oxazepam/Shorter acting Benzo's.

Consult your Doctor. !!!

1450,Diazepam Oral,11/13/2022,25-34,Male,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Panic Disorder,4.7,5,5,4,"RXd for PTSD and Panic Disorder. I switched from 400mg Phenobarbital / 6mg Klonopin to 3mg Klonopin at detox as I was abusing barbiturates. I stayed on 3mg Klonopin for a couple years but would run out early frequently so my psychiatrist recomended 40mg Diazepam daily. I had used it successfully in the past so acquiesed. Once I comfotably swtiched I found Valium to be more effective overall for my PTSD and panic attacks. The long half life keeps a steady amount in your system so you don't get inter dose withdrawal like with Xanax or Halcion. It also has pronounced muscle relaxation effects which are a big plus. I would warn anyone that euphoria and addiction can happen with ,Valium, I'd say more so than Klonopin but less than Restoril and long term benzo use should be seriously thought about *carefully*. 
I've been on 40mg Valium a day for about 5 years now and I still find it effective for my Panic disorder and PTSD, it eliminates flashbacks and kills panic. I find Valium to be the best all around benzo for me personally. Read More Read Less  "

1454,Diazepam Oral,5/22/2022,45-54,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Muscle Spasm,4.3,4,5,4,I have been having neck pain for a few months now. It has progressed to the point where I am having severe problems in the right side of my neck my right shoulder and my right scapula. I have tried baclofen a long time ago which helped back then. I tried Flexeril which to the absolutely nothing for me. I then tried Zanaflex 4 mg which worked for me however I must have aggravated the injury I am putting discs and two nights ago I was watching a movie and all the sudden I had wrenching pain and swelling of the right side of my body muscles with a stinging burning sensation almost like if you try to step on a foot that fell sleep all throughout my scalp my entire neck  my right clavicle down the right side into my right shoulder and 1/2 of my right upper arm my right breast was tingling and burning and my right upper back. I went to put clothes in a towel on and my boyfriend saw black and blue mark going from my spine horizontally across to my side  I tried to stretch it out I tried everything I could including Aspercreme lidocaine a tens unit the muscle relaxants Aleve etc. I finally was told to go to the emergency room where I received 5 mg of Valium within 15 minutes I was able to lay flat. When I first walked into the ER I couldn’t even sit down because if I laid on the muscle it hurts 100 times worse  I was prescribed 5 mg every six hours as needed with a two day supply I have found that I only need to take it twice a day it works absolutely wonders. I am trying not to take it unless the pain is so severe that I cannot touch the muscle so that  the eight tablets will last me longer as I do not believe any physician is going to refill this medication. I believe benzodiazepines have gotten a bad reputation however when taken as directed or as needed without substance-abuse history they were extremely helpful. I was told not to take it with my anxiety medicine or with muscle relaxants and I do not need then it clears my anxiety Way much more than At and I’ve also realized that it has stopped my migraine headaches I’m not sure if this is coincidence or not.

1455,Diazepam Oral,4/29/2022,35-44,Male,2 to less than 5 years,,Seizure with Loss of Normal Tone or Strength,3.0,3,3,3,"Guys, when your body goes into fight or flight mechanism. When it is scared it produces certain stress chemicals like adrenaline and cortisone. These chemicals help prime us for action but when this mechanism is over functionenong then side effects will be muscular tension. This is a side effect of anxiety. Please listen to me, and I know many of you are not going to want to hear this, bit the best remedy for all of these conditions including depression and anxiety is a good diet and regular exercise. When I mean good diet I mean, avoid processed and refined foods and cut down on stimulants. Exercise creates endorphins and dopamine which are great for anxiety. I know everyone wants a quick fix but diazepam are not good because the effectiveness of the treatment wears off after 4-8 weeks. They then become pretty much obsolete and actually do more harm to your anxiety and muscle problems than good. If you feel you really need treatment then Clonazepam is best for muscle seizures, Lorazepam for panic attacks and aprazolam for chronic anxiety. if you struggle my email is bendonagasaki8 at gmail dot com Read More Read Less  "

I find it can be helpful and doesn't really have any  bad side effects ( like disgusting anti depressants that make u worse). I also use to take valerian root when I can afford it which has same affect both for me can be hit & miss if they work. I have a high tolerance to things though. So I ive found on sometimes a certain dose might work for something and other days not at all.. today my anxiety was awful and I felt panicky and it wouldn't go away and I remember having panic attack few weeks ago going to shop trying to walk off. Today I put 5ml under my tongue but didn't expect it to work as its way to low for me (I get a prescription  classed as 5 ml to take a day, but I just take when needed and what I jeed)after20minutes took other 5ml but nothing. So got some food watched film but still hours later was awful ( nearly gave up and got a beer) so took another 10ml and felt my panic anxiety start to ease off only obviously a side effect is it can make you sleepy had nap now and woke with no stress or anxiety. I don't like that there is so much negativity from Dr's to prescribe this. When its a lot safer option than Anti depressants which don't work & I've self harmed on numerous times. Yet Drs will throw those at you like candy . Ridiculous when a person would need to take from 2000mg at once to have overdose. They're not perfect and as I say are hit and miss but when I can push myself to use them and they do work they're Great.

1458,Diazepam Oral,8/12/2021,25-34,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Other,4.7,4,5,5,"I am diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, and social anxiety. I take diazepam for anxiety and muscle tension. I love it because how long the effects last, and the physical effects are great. I get severe headaches 15+ days a month, nausea from anxiety, trouble falling asleep, and muscle tension. I have tried various muscle relaxers which don't work. I also take Fioricet for my headaches but can't take that everyday. I cannot take ibuprofen anymore due to getting two ulcers. So diazepam 5mg does the trick for many of my issues. I think that it's best if you have physical issues alongside your anxiety. Because frankly it's not the best at killing anxiety. It can take a bit to kick in. I think clonazepam is better for pure mental anxiety. But for me personally, my anxiety/stress manifests itself physically in so many ways. And then I become more anxious and upset because I'm feeling physically uncomfortable. I sometimes only have to take half or even a quarter of a 5mg tablet, and I'll feel better while still being able to work. And it lasts for a very long time which is probably my favorite part. But as I said it's not the best benzo for anxiety in my opinion, I think clonazepam is better for anxiety but it doesn't help all these physical issues the same way and doesn't last anywhere near as long.

The only thing that works for me is lorazepam/Ativan, Klonopin/clonazepam or Xanax/alprazolam - which I do not like taking, but will they will help my panic.  I had a severe panic attack with dissociation and kept taking diazepam and waited and waited for it to work to kill the attack - it took forever.  If I had any other Benzo, like lorazepam or Klonopin it would have killed the panic attack in 20 minutes.  Thumps down for diazepam for me. However, everyone is different.

1465,Stelazine Oral,9/19/2023,19-24,Male,less than 1 month,,Mental Disorder with Loss of Normal Personality,2.0,1,4,1,"I was prescribed Stelazine around 1970 for a condition hardly known at the time, on the supposition that I was ""pre-schizoid"". What I really had was depersonalization/ derealization syndrome. But that's all beside the point.

This drug I could call the pill from hell; and I later learned it was a drug of choice in the Soviet Union for softening up dissidents, AKA ""mentally ill"" people.

Its pharmacological affinities with with thorazine, etc. notwithstanding, it has an 'effectiveness', as it were, distinct from causing tranquility. It was like a psychotropic egg-beater were shoved into the mind and turned on. Thought-processes were mangled with a terrible sense of confusion; ideation was realized in disconnected phrase units. Externally-viewed by others I could imagine the appearance of tranquilization: here's a subject no longer concerned with CIA alien insects beaming mind-control rays through the walls.

That wouldn't be because your deranged thinking was calmed down, as with other antipsychotics, but because your thought-processes had become too disarticulated to assemble such a fanciful scenario, let alone sustain it.

Mind, I had no psychotic ideation in the first place, being misdiagnosed, as I said.

This was so taxing to deal with, I was left in cycles of exhaustion and would lie down to sleep it off. But that wasn't the worst of Stelazine: I could hardly  b r e a t h e  except through a deliberate act of will. The breathing reflex was virtually gone. I had to spend my every conscious seconds pulling air into my lungs and letting it out. In... and out.... in...and out... Minutes, hours, with these mangled thoughts, and the barely sustainable chore of doing what everyone does naturally: getting oxygen. Which all made the business of collapsing to sleep even more imperative. So on this double whammy, one can see how the word ""tranquilizer"" applies to this thing: You're too mentally battered with incoherent thoughts to sustain irrational thoughts, and too invested in breathing to concentrate on space aliens.

That was one pill, and I stopped right then and there. Perhaps I escaped with my life from asphyxiation.

It does take upwards of half an hour, but if I catch my seizures as they start, usually it saves me from having to take a trip to the Emergency Room. I know they getting tired of seeing me there. It also saves me from being overly sedated due to use of other (benzos and barbiturates) medications administered in an ambulance. (I was once sedated for 6 hours because they used a high dose of Versed (midasolam) and was not too happy and quite confused, because I was alone in the hospital and had left my 2 year old with my mom when I was carted off on an ambulance. I am also what the nurses call a ""runner"" (Versed puts you in ""twilight"" which means you are unconscious, but still able to respond to those around you. You are completely unaware of your actions. Basically if they give me Versed, it would be in their best interest to handcuff me to the bed because I will get up and walk away having no clue where I am going or what I am doing. At this point I just ask for Ativan.)

My overall results have been great using it every few days for my seizures. Realize I do not take it every day, so do not think I am saying that. I have had no addiction issues or side effects from stopping/starting it. I have had no side effects all it seems, and best of all it doesn't taste absolutely terrible (think propranolol or alprasalam, both of which I have had to spit out before because they were so bitter they made me gag).

I am still working my way up to 50 mg daily am at 40 right now. My main reason for taking it was to counter my numbness in feet hands and balance problems, but worse horrible back spasms. Some lasting as long as six weeks without relief. The doctor is raising the serotonin levels in hopes he can change the pain which seems to originating in my brain. Still working on the possible diagnosis of M.S., often the plaque in the brain does NOT show in MRI or scans. Other than constipation, so far so good. I am sleeping better, but it has not completely stopped the muscle spasms..however I have not  yet reached the therapeutic levels. I don't have depression as an issue, but sometimes I do feel anxious. I am so hoping this works. I fall, have no balance often neuropethy in both arms and legs. Obviously something is going wrong.

This can be very uncomfortable in an office job.  I eventually found that I had to reduce my dose by half.  Then I started taking it every other day, when I left work in the evening.  I also found that the med had an even greater GI effect if I took it first thing in the mornning before I had sufficient liquids to drink.  I also discovered through trial and error that it is much easier on your system if you have food to eat with it.  I think that it makes the absorption of the medication a bit slower.

1534,Tofranil Oral,10/12/2021,45-54,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Problems with Bladder Control,5.0,5,5,5,"I had a bout of bedwetting when I was about 10 or 11 years old.  I was prescribed Tofranil, and it not only stopped the bedwetting issue, but I remember that during the time I was on it (a few weeks, I think) it became a brief slice of absolute mental and psychological paradise!  Not only was I able to stop bedwetting, but I began to have much better clarity of thinking (not that I had a problem concentrating when I wanted to--I read books all the time, at an advanced level for my age--but what I experienced on Tofranil was an invigorated DESIRE to concentrate on things , above and beyond whatever entertained or interested me in the moment), AND I also discovered that I had an enhanced level of what I would call ""ambition for the routine""--I started cleaning up my room, doing my ""chores"" (I grew up in the '70s), and doing my homework--and actually ENJOYING those things; I actually felt a keen sense of fulfillment at doing my chores and homework, and doing them well!  I had never been particularly enthusiastic about ANY of that stuff, but when I was taking Tofranil, I had a sort of self-discipline renaissance, which was accompanied by an overall enhanced satisfaction with life and with myself.  But, when my original problem was solved and I no longer wet the bed, my mom would not let me have a refill because she was afraid I might get addicted to it.  But, after I ceased using it, my newfound ""ambition"" and zest for self-discipline deteriorated, and my whole mental attitude slouched back to what it had been (most often, laziness and lack of ambition), although that customary sluggishness was interrupted every so often throughout my life by brief periods of energy bursts in which I would do a whirlwind bedroom-cleaning session, do my chores and homework with gusto for a day or two or three, or pursue a certain project with alacrity(very much like when I was on Tofranil, only not as intense or long-lasting).  But these brief outbursts of mental and emotional energy would quickly subside, and I would return to the same old long-term languid indolence again.  I have never--either before or since taking Tofranil--experienced anything close to that sustained period of a few weeks of mental bliss and energetic enthusiasm for life.  I remember it fondly to this day...Read More Read Less  "

There is perhaps a mild history of heart issues in my family although my father lived to 89 and my mother is still going strong at 88. Every year I get an EKG and check to make sure everything is okay in conjunction with taking this medicine. I wouldn't get an EKG otherwise. My two issues are:  I'm a runner and I'm quite active. I think this medication taxes my endurance and I'm concerned about long term heart & health ramifications-I have small children otherwise, I wouldn't care so much. Sometimes, walking up the stairs causes me to get out of breath despite running three or four miles a day and very hilly miles at that. Does anyone else who exercises notice this type of problem? I am thinking about discussing with my Dr and and considering dropping my dosage.   From reading the reviews, it sounds like this really helps many folks which is really great. However, for those who have been on many different anti-depressants at significant doses and gone around and around with numerous doctors, you may understand my frustration-trusting in your Dr. I'm not saying he/she isn't good but sadly, after years of medication issues & depression, I've had to become my own expert and now I feel like I have to make all of the moves or recommendations or initiate things.

This drug made him sad, paranoid and weepy. After three days I told doc I was taking him off. She convinced me he would get used to it and to keep him on for another week. At ten days, my son was clearly getting depressed and was still wetting the bed. I took him off it. Being on Tofranil for ten days changed my child. It made him less confident, more anxious, and fearful of many imagined things. It took a year for him to come back to being just his usual weird self. Now he is 11 and still wets the bed once a week average. Gradually he seems to be growing out of it. His therapist thinks he would benefit from being on Zoloft but I am very concerned - once bitten twice shy - I see he struggles with anxiety and some darkness sometimes (didn't we all at age 11?) so I am going to NOT put him on meds just yet. Now we are increasing his excercise daily and hopefully this will give his brain a joy and peace boost naturally. Read More Read Less  "

My doctor originally prescribed it for sleeplessness. However, as time went on, I found it to help me with temporary bouts of depression as well.  My current doctor is of the opinion that if a medication helps you function better in life, there's nothing wrong with taking it.  Imipramine has certainly helped me. Yes, I've gained weight but I've also lost weight. I was a yo-yo dieter before taking Imipramine. Losing weight is all between the ears.

Alprazolam ER 2mg with Alprazolam 0.5 mg (prn) has truly saved my life.  Anxiety attacks are no joke!  I loved to travel - and with this med I was able to fly 3 hrs to Chicago from Raleigh and back (a miracle back in the 80's - 90's).  Unfortunately, with age - people tend to add more disease diagnoses, more meds and maintenance meds often lose their effectiveness over the years. Yet there is so little emphasis on mental illness (Why?!) ... that newer, more effective meds, treatments or surgeries just don't exist.  At least not in this country!  Xanax remains the premium, most effective treatment. Yet, the stigma still persists in an ignorant place.  Our gov't keeps making these meds (not drugs!) more costly and harder for patients to access.  ""Show your ID!"" Fewer, if any refills, etc.  Just because ""some people"" abuse drugs - does NOT make it OK to threaten, harass, punish or make it more difficult for (patients!) through no fault of their own - to obtain the meds they NEED for their dx. condition.  ""Tricyclics"" (in the 80's) were the only meds I was ever prescribed that worked for me better than Xanax or any anti-depressants ... they worked well!  But were (somehow) discontinued or fell out of favor.  Who cares if they get TD (maybe) if they can have a normal, decent life again!  Or if they don't commit suicide because they can't get the help/meds they need ... Your health involves your ""Mind + Body + Spirit"" all intricately working together.  Problems with one - involve ALL of the rest.  Thank you.  Retired RNC, BSN (20 yrs)Read More Read Less  "

Before you start know what you are getting into. Have a discussion with your doctor about a plan on how long you will be on it, a plan to taper off it, and a long term plan to deal with your anxiety. Xanax is a band aid and it has serious side effects. Anyone who says it doesnâ??t is a flat out liar. It messes with your memory for starters. You build up a tolerance quickly and will need a higher dose to get your desired effect. Once you have taken enough for long enough you canâ??t just stop taking it. You can have seizures and die. Many periodontal know this and doctors donâ??t bother mentioning it when the give or out. My advice would be only take it when you really need it and try to find a way to deal with your anxiety long term without this drug.

It is the only one that helped, although high doses caused shortness of breath, low-back pain, nightmares, stress, and anxiety.  The key has been finding the correct dose.  An important discovery was that chocolate produces a synergistic effect.  Taking it in the evening right after a large serving of dark chocolate and 10 ounces of milk allows me to keep the dose and prescription costs low.  It is not nearly as effective without chocolate during the day.  But a problem is that it is addictive.  Increasing the dose made me more depressed but going down improved my mood, so finding the optimal one has been difficult. Read More Read Less  "

The Integrated Visual Auditory continuous performance test rated my ADHD so severe that I tested several decimal places below the 1 percentile. And I've tried all the on and off label drugs. Amphetamine Salts works the best and that is still not worth the dry mouth unless I'm behind on sleep.    I've been on Desipramine for 5 weeks now starting at 75 and now up to 225. It gives me in order of severity: severe dry mouth (like all the others), somnolence(strong desire for sleep), sinus congestion, lowers my energy and motivation, and gave me a near death experience when I took desipramine 150, amphetamine salts IR 30 and propranolol IR 80 all at the same time without much breakfast or drink. Instead of helping get things done, it's making it even harder to get things done. All 3 use the same 2D6 enzyme and amphetamine and desipramine enhance each other which gave me several of desipramine's side effects. Caffeine works better than amphetamine for not interacting with desipramine, but still increases the dry mouth terribly. Looks like a cholinergic deficit but Galantamine didn't do anything. Pilocarpine relieves my dry mouth but doesn't solve the core attention problem.Read More Read Less  "

Going on too high of a dose made me feel drugged, anxious, grouchy, and... well, depressed.  Although I played around with the time of day I took the lower dose, I still felt more like a tired zombie than a happy person, even if I didn’t have any emotional breakdowns.  Also, my weight went up sixteen pounds in the three months I took it.  Plus, it seemed to mess with my ability to form new memories.

I had extremely dry eyes, very painful and it is for the rest of my life. I am often forced to lie down in extreme pain, in tears. Doctors are pill pushers that do not read the labels.

1673,Amitriptyline Oral,2/5/2023,19-24,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Migraine Prevention,3.3,4,5,1,"I was prescribed this medication for two different reasons. Primarily it was prescribed to help prevent migraines, which it does a great job at. Secondly, for insomnia, which is a bit iffy, but not horrible. I’ve been on this medication for a few months now and I have many notes.

1. Every morning I wake up with dry eyes, dry mouth. Dry mouth leads to my throat becoming sore because I talk constantly at work. 

2. As another person mentioned, I am incredibly irritable. I am usually a cheerful woman, but as of late, I get irritable with everyone very quickly and over silly things. 

3. This medication has caused me to have tachycardia. Last night I took a trip to urgent care (for unrelated issues) but they were more concerned with my BPM which was averaging 135-142 while resting. I was not nervous, just didn’t feel well. I have made notes to my significant other many times about my heart rate seeming abnormally high for no reason. Doing very mundane tasks causes my heart rate to soar. It usually feels like I can’t satisfyingly breath. 

Overall, this medication works for my migraines, but when it comes to side effects like tachycardia (which can put a lot of stress on your heart if it goes on for an extended period of time) it’s not worth it in my opinion. Not every person who takes Amitriptyline will experience tachycardia, but please be aware that it CAN happen. If you already have underlying health issues with your heart, this can be incredibly dangerous. Read More Read Less  "

I stay completely knocked out what feels I slept for an hour or 2 waking up to 8 hours passed. If I have to get up before 8 hours I feel so groggy almost drunk like and even when I do get up for  the day it takes so long now to actually feel awake. I take it and within an hour you can’t even fight if you tried it will 100% knock you out cold. It’s been a few weeks that symptom hasn’t got any better.

I did have a few days where I was late for work, but once I realized that the doxepin was making me sleep that deeply, I simply timed my dose so that I'd crash around 10 pm, and wake up at 7 pm fully rested.

1717,Doxepin Oral,8/30/2022,25-34,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Chronic Trouble Sleeping,4.7,5,4,5,"Sorry ahead of time for a novel length review, but I think all following aspects are important to take into account with this medication as I take many medications and have many disorders. I also have never written a review for a medication, but after reading these scary reviews before taking Doxepin I felt the need to throw my two cents in to maybe encourage people to at least try it before flat out saying no to their doctor.

A bit of my background: I have bipolar, insomnia, general anxiety, panic disorder, and ADHD which of course all of those, and the corresponding medications taken for each disorder, make getting a good nights sleep a nightmare (no pun intended). I've had difficulty sleeping since I was a teenager, and after being diagnosed in my early 20s with all those issues it made sense why I have  so much trouble sleeping. I have also been incredibly tired during the day every single day of my life (even while using stimulants in the daytime for my ADHD) since I can remember, and I started thinking I had a type of narcolepsy because I just felt like a zombie every day (hypochondriac much???).

I have taken so many different sleep aids over the years: Ambien, Lunesta, Hydroxyzine, Trazodone, you name it. All of which made me incredibly groggy the next day, or just gave me unwanted side effects (thank you Ambien for the four hour hallucinations that I didn't ask for of fairies flying around a forest that grew on my walls keeping me up which completely defeated the purpose of Ambien). I had brought up my sleep issues to my psychiatrist before, but never the chronic daytime sleepiness. I finally brought it up to her, and she thought that I may be constantly tired due to poor sleep. I didn't believe it at first because I rarely remember waking up during the night. 

Now to the medication: She mentioned Silenor aka Doxepin this go around, and how at high doses it is used for depression, but in very low doses it is used to help people to sleep. I was very interested as it's not habit forming (I don't need or want more addictive medications than I already take), and at the low doses for sleep it has pretty minimal side effects. For reference, I currently take the lowest 3mg dose as that is enough for me, and I have not found the need to double up to 6mg. 

However, I was incredibly worried about taking this medication because of one of the more scary side effects: sleep driving, walking, eating, etc. just like Ambien can potentially cause. For the first five days taking this medication I gave my car keys to my mom to hide at night, had potentially dangerous items stored away by my family where I wouldn't find them if I did sleep walk, and had my family keep an eye on me for any signs of sleep ""doing"" things. 

When I woke up the following mornings there were absolutely no signs of sleep ""doing"" things, thank goodness. My doctor was right about why I was so tired during the day because I have even better news; I felt the most well rested I ever have, and I can't even remember the last time I woke up feeling this great. I woke up feeling weirdly amazing even before my alarm went off when I usually press snooze 10 times, no grogginess at all, had enough energy all day to get everything done that needed to be done.

I have now been taking this medication for about two months with no issues, and still wake up feeling great and well rested. I really hope this one doesn't stop randomly working for me like other medications have in the past. Some nights I will forget to take it, and I definitely notice a major difference the next day where I'm tired and groggy compared to when I do take it. I rated ""ease of use"" a four only due to having to take it on an empty stomach (at least 3 hours since you've last eaten), but sometimes I forget that I ate recently and haven't noticed a difference in efficacy of sleep. Not sure why you have to take it on an empty stomach, but that's a question to ask your doctor.

Well unannouced to me I was at 200 mg per night and according to my doctor, that's the maximum you can take and at that level there are risks of a heart attack. So if you are at this level of dosage, you may want to consider other options. I, choose after 30 years of being on it to stop taking it all together. To tell the truth here, I feel a lot better now, losing weight and not so jittery any more. I quit cold turkey nd those who try will experience sleeplessness rebound. For awhile you wont sleep but if you adjust your sleep habits, all will be fine. Honestly here when i quit Doxepin, I tried to remember back 30 years why I was put on it in the first place and my memory failed me. Although I quit the drug not telling my doctor of my plan as in the past , he always told me not to quit it cold turkey, to slowly go off it with the help of a withdrawal program. My pills were costly me $140.00 for a month supply and for a drug that in my opinion wasn't working anymore. Remember, this is only my experience with Doxepin, everyone is different.

I didn't find it changed his personality much. If anything, he seemed a bit more focused and calm but nothing substantial.Read More Read Less  "

It's a shame because imipramine works very well. I took it only at bedtime, as an adjunct to my 3x/day Xanax for panic attacks, but man -- throughout the following day dizziness, blurred vision, heart flutters & sticky mouth was, oh man, strong. Also had this other weird side effect, felt like my penis was being pinched & strangulated. Very harsh side effects. Yes, all the tricyclics have the same set of side effects, but it's usually not so noticeable at low, therapeutic doses. I much prefer nortryptiline (Pamelor) which works every bit as good for anxiety, preventing panic attacks and general depression, but the side effects aren't nearly as prominent as imipramine's. In fact I'd be surprised if imipramine is even prescribed anymore.Read More Read Less  "

I formerly had a resection of lower colon for diverticulosis in 1994. I suffered from debilitation abdominal pain almost ecvery day. By chance, a friend was taking this drug for depression and offered me a pill at bed time and said it will make ""Me sleep better.""  Why not? I thought it was a sleeping pill.  I went to bed and the next day my epgastric pain was gone, bowel sounds galore and things started to move in digestion. No longer have constipation or the opposite or abdominal pain.     Funny, I am not depressed at all, have a great life as a retired professional, have a boat, many homes, cars  and doing just fine. I had MRIs cat scans, barium swallows etc. etc. and they found nothing. I short, I have my life back. The only down side is that I wake up early (4AM)sometimes and feel a tad tired in the late afternoon.        This help  may be anecdotal as to me, but it cured a problem no doctor could cure and it was just by chance. I notice no side effects other then an earlier rise then usual which is 5:30 AM.I take 10 mg and sometimes cut them in half (5mg)  or skip a day or two. Amazing luck . As an aside, i got a warning   letter in the mail about this drug. As a old cynic watching the money cycle in drug companies, I think the drug companies sent this out to get you on  a more expensive anti-depressent. (that is its primary use I am told). This drug is cheap and I guess their monopoly on it has expired. Big Pharma's motto is ""Make as much as you can as fast as you can.""  You be the judge.Read More Read Less  "

I was prescribed Endep10 by my doctor for chronic muscle pain in my neck.I has suffered with this for several weeks unable to sleep or even sit comfortably. The first night I took this it severely knocked me out all night. I woke in the morning at 6am with severe brain fog till 11am in the morning. The next night I started to have vivid psychotic nightmares that I was too drug induced to awake from. After that I through the rest of the medication in the bin. I chose the pain of sleepless nights. I then went to a masseuse who noted that my first rib could be felt through the area behind my collar bone and shoulder blade. Saying that there should not be bone there. I then went to a chiropractor who say that my neck muscles were so tight that they were pulling my first rib up into that region. He did a manipulation that at the time it released was immense pain with instant relief.
This trouble with my neck never returned. I had never used alternative methods prior to this always seeking the doctors advise only. I now know there are more roads to travel now when you have troubles.

The niravam works quickly & helps me feel ""normal"" again. it has helped me clear my head & resume a normal life. as one person said, her boss made her feel worse & I would caution telling any boss about this condition because there is still such a stigma (esp with males) that depression & anxiety are only excuses that can be cures by ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps""  I think a lot of anxiety is cause by bosses who make themselves feel better by putting down others - they should probably be on medication themselves.Read More Read Less  "
1807,Niravam Oral,8/1/2008,65-74,Female,10 years or more,Patient,Anxiousness associated with Depression,5.0,5,5,5,"Niravam (1 mg 4x/day PRN) used with Cymbalta  (60 mg. 2x/day) has been a life saver for me.  Having several deaths (my husband & mother), and then loosing my home were just the icing on the cake.  Thankfully, I have a psychiatrist who knows me well, and respects my knowledge of medication - giving me professional courtesy, as I was a mental health nurse.  We are able to sit and discuss my problems, and I am able to give him appropriate feedback.  My current dosage is extrememly  effective, and I find that there are days when I do not have to use the full 4 mg. dosage.  This is encouraging, but knowing that the Niravam is there if I do need it is  comforting.  Having lived with GAD and Clinical Depression since I was 17, and not knowing what it was until I entered the Mental Health field was a horror.  Thinking I was going to die while driving, having to pull over and catch my breath and wait for my heart to stop pounding at a very young age until I was 30, did not give me very much independence.  Upon learning how dibilitating these conditions were, and then being treated for them, certainly made a difference in my quality of life.  Prior to the introduction of Niravam, I was taking alprazalome (generic), which was just ok, and did keep me calmer.  Now that Niravam is on the market, and was given to me immediately, I can't say enough about it.  The only problem I'm having are the co-pays for both Niravam and Cymbalta (now $40 each every month), and it is becoming a hardship, as these are not the only high co-pays I have.  Patient assistance programs would certainly be beneficial to persons in my category, disabled, widowed, and on a fixed income.  Read More Read Less  "

From the moment I started taking it, I noticed a significant shift in my social anxiety. The racing thoughts and paralyzing fear began to subside, allowing me to engage in social situations with greater confidence and ease. Nardil gave me the ability to navigate social interactions without the constant worry of being judged or rejected. In addition to its impact on social anxiety, Nardil also proved to be a game-changer in my battle against treatment-resistant depression.

Med is a ""life saver"", take two 10 milligrams/day. Had MD's who wanted to ""try something else"", so tried Valium, Klonopin, Xanex(sp?). These DID NOT WORK well and had side effects, so they did return to the Serax (generic). I have no side effects, such as drowsiness or concentration difficulties, only relief from a life-long suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. If anything, it seems to provide more clarity in my thinking. Rarely take more than prescribed, sometimes less. Also very helpful when I am having a really difficult time sleeping because of anxiousness.  Although I no longer drink alcohol, I was a pretty heavy social drinker for some time. I really didn't take the med much when drinking, but don't recall that it caused a problem, however I do not recommend taking any med of this sort with alcohol. This med is especially helpful when having to do things, such as teach a class or address a group, something that was almost impossible for me to do without fear of a panic attack or extreme nervousness. I have no reason or plans to discontinue its use unless I find that I no longer need it, and this would only become known to me by noticing that I was simply taking less of the med daily. I think it is great, and based on my experience with the other prescriptions I've had for anxiety, don't understand why it isn't prescribed more often. Most people I know have never heard of it, but they all have heard of Valium and Xanex (sp?), which I think have terrible side effects and are much more addictive. Read More Read Less  "

Dr. leaves and i can't find a psychiatrist to continually prescribing.  Meanwhile my personal life was crumbling and i was isolating and the worst part was the constant feeling on dread, shakijng, feeling heavy in the chest, poundng heart, etc.  Finally, my friend told me she takes Xanax and gave me 1mg and said , try this, cuz i was that bad.  
Well i took it and i found inside me a different person.  Within minutes i was getting calmer, one symtom at a time. I did not get drowsy in the least.  it was like the world stopped spinning. I then whent to another doctor, my pcp and told him everything.  He saw truth in my story and immediately got me started on xanax.  Since then, i have been more outgoing, less scared, less anxous and was building my life up and it's almost back together again. Thanks for this med. Thank u to the friend and the doctor.

I have always considered Xanax a godsend, it is an excellent anxiolytic and it is very useful also for those suffering from sleep disorders, because it does not leave heaviness or numbness the next day, due to its short duration of action in the body. My average dosage is 20 drops (0.50 mg). What can I say, to me it is the best anxiolytic!Read More Read Less  "

I am a video producer and when a big event is coming up I tend to get very anxious and if things don't go smoothly the anxiety gets worse until sometimes I can't properly function. This is also related to the fact that I am a perfectionist, so if things don't go smoothly (at work) I often break out into heavy sweats. My doctor prescribed very low dose Xanax (.25 mg) and I usually cut the pills in half. One half of a pill calms me down quite well when necessary.  I take another half only if things become very stressful. The med does exactly what it's supposed to do for my anxiety. I don't abuse Xanax at all - a 20 pill prescription will last me a year or more. My doctor also monitors and controls my usage carefully.Read More Read Less  "

Make sure your medical team sees you every week and hopefully they will see the drastic change in your demeaner.

It allows me to function at a high level while maintaining my stability and I have not been hospitalized since I have been on this medication (2003).  Unfortunately, I was not able to completely stop the zyprexa I had been taking; I still need a small dose of 2.5mg of that as well.  But along with my mood stabilizer (lamictal) and my antidepressant(wellbutrin   SR), I never dreamed I would be this stable.  I have some side effects, though nothing that bothersome.  I have occasional muscle twitches, which I choose to put up with rather than add yet another medication (like cogentin).  I am almost completely symptom free.  I have read that loxapine is very similar to clozapine, but doesn't cause as much weight gain or blood disorders.  Oh, that's another thing: I have been able to lose over 70 lbs since going on this drug and reducing the zyprexa.  I HIGHLY recommend this drug for schizophrenia or schizoaffective; I'm not sure why it's not prescribed more often.  I suspect it is almost as effective as clozapine.Read More Read Less  "

Took me two more days of his significant discomfort for me to convince him to take the prescribed med.  Within 4hrs of initial dose hiccups ended and did not return. Monitored his steadiness.  He took a 2nd dose, then refused med due to ""feeling tired and sleeping all the time"".  Remember he's 90 and sleeps a lot most days, and had been sleep deprived due to hiccups.

Actually there was no room outside of my door to begin with, which made that even weirder. And the fact no men lived at this facility, as it was a shelter for battered women. My ex wasn't even the one I was hiding from, as we had been divorced over a decade. Then one day I really snapped. Was paranoid and mad and scared the staff and so for the second time in 2 weeks they called in a squad of mental health professionals to deal with me. Tem minutes later I forgot the whole thing. Then approx. ten days later I did it again (whatever it was) so they called the cops and the squad people again. I was escorted by four people to the mental ward for observation and didn't know why they were acting so funny.

I am using 6 mg of Invega, 1500 mg of Depakote ER, & 60 mg of Cymbalta.  I feel better than ever before.  Good luck..  Also, this is the best atypical antipsychotic, in my opinion, because of its efficacy (how well it works) & side effect profile (none that I've noticed besides low blood pressure which is actually a good thing in most instances)  They use special technology to allow the drug to be metabolized over a 24 hour period which is best for symptom control.

My son’s psychosis has vastly improved since taking this medication. Prior to taking the Invega injection, he wouldn’t leave the house because he always thought that someone was going to kill him. He was anxious, depressed and paranoid. He’s a good kid. Doesn’t drink or do drugs but was extremely paranoid due to his mental illness.  Now, he’s riding his mountain bike, fishing, playing tennis and is even going to start work part time. He has his life back and I have my son back. It’s so much easier for him to have one injection a month and not have to take pills everyday.

He’s an ultra-rapid metabolizer(did the GeneSights Cheek swab test) and not a lot of drugs to choose from for that. Trying Risperdal with Trileptal right now, not much better. Had to call 911 due to attacking me last summer over nothing. Invega has a long half life and takes forever to come off of.

2049,Seroquel XR Oral,12/2/2016,45-54,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Other,5.0,5,5,5,"When I was prescribed Seroquel XR for severe anxiety recently, I wasn't expecting good results. Instead I anticipated getting bad side effects. I didn't like the idea of taking an anti-psychotic medicine. But almost immediately this XR version of Seroquel showed itself to be the best answer for me.     It literally makes me 'normal', more normal than I've ever seen myself,  and so far none of the side effects I expected have occurred. Not even after the doctor doubled my dose to 100 mg.     I am Cool-As-a-Cucumber around the clock, but not lethargic or lazy. I convey my thoughts in a measured and logical fashion, yet my personality isn't dulled. I stop sweating & trembling when around people, I don't fear everything. I sleep well and don't feel so depressed & hopeless when I wake up. And all that crazy paranoia seems to be gone now.     Best of all I don't feel like a drugged-up zombie, nor is my vision blurred or my mouth dry - none of the side effects one would normally expect from an anti-psychotic drug. I wish I'd been introduced to Seroquel XR sooner. It doesn't give the same harsh side effects that regular (immediate release) Seroquel does.Read More Read Less  "

For this reason I am making a switch to a similar medicine which will hopefully have a similar outcome with less side effects.

Meanwhile, the abscess was eating through my jaw bone.  After it was finally big enough to be discovered, about 10 - 12 months,(and x-rays got more precise) and the abscess was taken care of,  it went away for 20 years. I then moved and found a new dentist who did NOT LISTEN to me!  He made a night guard for the wrong area of my mouth and the TGN started again. Had two very severe attacks in 2017 and I have been using  Carbamazepine as needed when I feel twinges.  I have been very lucky.  I want to let you know about an organic essential that was introduced to me in a health/natural store. You roll it on the outside of the area causing the pain and I have found it to be extremely helpful.  It is VERIDITAS by Pranarom and is called: Just Plain Relief.  Yes,  that's  Plain (with an ""l"").  I take two 200 mg grams of Carba... twice a day and if I do get a spasm, I roll this on.  I find it very soothing and considerably helpful.

2064,Carbamazepine Oral,3/18/2019,55-64,,10 years or more,Patient,Epileptic Seizure,5.0,5,5,5,"I have used carbamazepine ER for 30 years and it has worked well except for 2 seizures 14 years ago which I attribute to 'the change.'  I had to increase my doseage to a total of 1100mg/day, split between morning and evening.  I have had some memory loss, but that started just after my first seizure when I was 35 and was told it was brain disintegration (can't think of the right word).  Finding words is sometimes difficult but can't know if it is the medication or the state of my brain after the seizure.  Every 3 weeks or so I have an aura where I can't follow conversation or process information well.  It ends with a headache so I know it is going away.  If often lasts all day and I may wake up with it.  I don't know if that means less control by the medicine or not.  At least I have not had any seizures for 14 years.  The only really BAD thing is that this drug is part of a class of AEDs that cause bone loss.  After all of these years, I have severe osteoporosis and broke my arm after a bad fall.  The surgeon had to pin everything together and said my bones were weaker than he had anticipated.  Considering I may have at least another 20 years to go, I am considering changing to another drug that does not affect bones.  However, all of the reviews I have read on those (lamotrigine, vimpat, topirimate and leviracetam) are very scary.  Taking Fosamax for my bones is not the answer, apparently, since I had been doing that for a number of years.  Anyone with any info on this is very appreciated.  I suggest all long term users to have bone density tests every 2 years - even the men.  Read More Read Less  "

He said he thinks its Trigeminal Neuralgia, sent me to ENT, who agreed, he sent me for MRI and to Neurologist, who also agrees it Tri Neuralgia. Now on Carbamazepine, which seems to help but only been on it for 3 weeks. Neuro wants to change that to gabapentin, but side effect reviews for that scare me. I haven't had any pain since 1-2-19, so hoping its working. My pain comes whenever, night or day and lasts anywhere from 1/2 hr to 2 hrs. Would rather go thru childbirth with no assistance than this pain. I'm hoping someone finds an effective cure for this because it's ruining my life-afraid to do anything or go anywhere because it starts out of nowhere. Don't want to embarass myself or my husband.

I am going to a Dentist today in hopes of extracting a tooth that may be pressing on the nerve.  I am not looking forward to the surgery options. All in all, the Carbemazepine did save my sanity for the time I have been on it. I could actually function as a normal human being this last week.

The medicine did work gor me. And the highest dosage I took was 1000 msg per day. But like all medicines there are side affects. I was feeling depression and at times suicidial but I never attempted to do anything so drastic. Because the pain of TN has been know to cause that.

I also cannot use my technical degree any more, because I became unemployable in the field of choice because of the brain damage. Now I have to rely on disability payments only, which is not enough to survive here. Working in an unskilled job is also hard because I have constant fatigue and have to take long breaks during work. I also cannot feel any self confidence any more, including in situations when a dangerous person is encountered on public transit etc. 5 years have passed since the treatment, and my condition has not improved.

Doctors need to listen to the patients more. Certain chemicals can really harm people. I was like that for weeks because it was forcefully given to me and it was extended release.

I need to go off the medication soon to drop in KG's but up until now my psychiatrist has not agreed to take me off and probably won't. Also I have intense suicidal ideation since taking this medication, every morning I wake up, they start. I pray that Invega and all the other medications (forms of modern day torture) cease to be administered in society. Until this day comes, the world will slow down and people will suffer. Invega like all anti-pyschotic meds should not be allowed to be given. Even if a person commits a crime that they say they ""didn't mean to commit,"" they either remain free or go to jail.

I thought this was ok...thinking meds were working but they were slowing me down where I lost all my dreams for the future.

He said this is like seroquel on high. He told me to take this with Benadryl. I was really confused by this, but I did it anyways. First night was great fell asleep in 15 minutes. I didn’t like my whole mouth going numb though. I woke up the next morning feeling great. I didn’t feel tired or drugged out for the first time in a long time. I didn’t take a nap all day either. The next night I tried taking it without the Benadryl, and things didn’t go well. I didn’t get sleepy at all and I waited an hour. Then I went ahead and took the Benadryl and went to bed. The next day I still felt good. A on going problem I started having was my hands and feet would start to go numb out of nowhere. It would like 15 to 30 minutes. Then on the 3rd and final day I woke up with the driest mouth ever! I thought I will just drink some water, and I will be good. That was not what happened. I chugged water all day long at work. Nothing helped. It felt like a desert in my mouth. I am no longer taking it. I can’t deal with all that. My doctor gave me something else to help me sleep I pick it up  tomorrow. I am glad to hear that it has worked for a lot of you. Read More Read Less  "

I got to school and was giggling with my then foster sister and all of a sudden i wasn't able to move. I had my then foster sister call my mother because the office lady didnt like me and wouldnt let us use her phone anyways my then foster sister set me in the office where i felt like i was drifting off... My mom showed up saw me first glance and rushed me to the emergency room. My heart stopped my mom was worried i was going to die. I was admitted to the hospital. I guess I had a allergic reaction and they told me if I had a stronger dosage i wouldn't have made it... Its sad that one pill can take a life. Anyways i know other people who have been on it and said they didn't like it. So 1000% wouldn't recommend.  Read More Read Less

For a few weeks it made my left eye twitch but that has stopped. It works really well at stopping hearing voices that are not there. Compared to other antipsychotics it's a life saver. Doesn't make me feel high at all. Causes some drowsiness where it feels really heavy and slow going up stairs. It's probably the best antipsychotic but antipsychotics seem to have really low standards. There are times in my day in stressful situations with lots of people around where I know that without fanapt I would definitely be hallucinating voices but the fanapt is still working. I've gained about 100 pounds though but it's not as bad as zyprexa. I think the weight gain is mostly from not exercising. It makes exercising harder. Sometimes if I get up real fast I can feel my heart beating really strong but I don't faint. I don't think it's making me overly hungry but it does make exercise more of a challenge.Read More Read Less

2177,Fanapt Oral,4/30/2014,35-44,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Additional Medications to Treat Depression,1.0,1,1,1,"This is the most awful medication on the market that can be used to treat bipolar disorder. It is an 'atypical' which is generally not prescribed for this however my doc wanted to try it since other RX weren't having much effect. The side effects were overwhelming with racing heart rate, low blood pressure, muscle aches, fatigue, drowsiness and dizziness being the worst. One major reason I stopped is because of the potential increase in aggression. I'm a competitive athlete and naturally aggressive and I do not want my aggression to become worse or violent. I've already injured myself prior to taking Fanapt due to my natural 'safe' aggressive behavior and recklessness but I do not want it to become a problem of violence where I could hurt others.    One other side effect that can affect athletes or people who exercise regularly is the abnormal rise in heart rate. My resting heart rate is between 40-50 which is very low. I noticed that my heart races to approximately 120 beats per minute or so just doing simple chores around the house. 120 beats per minute is normally a very vigorous workout for me so this is a crazy situation. Fanapt made exercise and training impossible.    Maybe this medication can help others who are resistant to the side effects however the cons outweigh the pros for me. This RX is a no go for me.Read More Read Less  "

The pluses have been majorly decreased anxiety (less panic attacks), less hallucinations, and better depression.

2210,Latuda Oral,6/22/2023,35-44,Female,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Bipolar Depression,1.0,1,1,1,"ONE STAR: The withdrawal is horrific if you already have Akathisia. One of the biggest side effects is Akathisia and no one talks about it. I had Akathisia from coming off meds cold turkey. Before being put on Latuda I was rapidly tapered off all my meds and given no time to adjust. The guy started Latuda along with another cocktail. I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar with depressive episodes. I’ve never been psychotic or had mania or even hypomania. Doctor tapered me too fast off Latuda and now I have all kinds of issues. New symptoms include grinding of teeth, jaw clenching, cracking jaw, flu like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, muscle twitches and spasms, itching, headaches/migraines, diarrhea, irritability, fatigue, chills/sweats, brain fog, and more. My symptoms of Akathisia and Insomnia are unbearable now after being tapered from 80mg (was at 120mg for awhile!) down by 20mg each month. When I complained about worse Akathisia, the guy told me to stop. I jumped at 20mg. Anyone who says there are no withdrawal symptoms from Latuda is a liar. Did they not do any research on coming OFF the med? Seems like they want to keep you on for life. It costs over $1k every time someone fills it. The doctor who prescribed it got perks from Latuda’s pharmaceutical company for prescribing. I have records. He had like a deal with them obviously as he kept me on samples for months until I was on the highest dose for bipolar depression or whatever the guy thought I had. Taking Latuda made me sleepy. As I was having Akathisia all the time, no it didn’t work for me. It didn’t help with anything. And no I didn’t get Akathisia being on the med (to my knowledge). Probably didn’t help that I was taking Latuda which gives lots of people Akathisia. So coming off didn’t help, no it’s not reversible and no the “treatment” for Akathisia does nothing to help. I can’t take Benzos as that’s what eventually caused Akathisia coming off CT. No clue if Latuda works. It does nothing for Benzo Withdrawal and Withdrawal Akathisia. I’m back to having all kinds of fun symptoms like waking up frantic and shivering, I have like mini panic attacks. My teeth chatter. I’m usually hyperventilating. That just started recently after coming off Latuda. When I wake up, I’m in terror. It feels like there is a surge of energy or battery acid flowing through my veins. Suicidal thoughts are an issue. I don’t want to die.Read More Read Less  "

The side effects for me were nausea, tardive dyskinesia, and when my psychiatrist took me from 40mg to 60mg I developed akathesia. I HAD to take another medication such as Clonidine to counteract the tardive dyskinesia, it was unbearable. I also simply could not tolerate a larger dose from 40mg. Overall, I would rate this drug fair to poor. I haven’t had a severe depressive episode for a few years which is great because my last one had me unable to get out of bed for 30 days. I still suffer from mild to moderate depression, though. I also have some suicidal thoughts still. As for the hypomanic episodes, they have not gone away and have still made my life a little unmanageable. I sometimes feel like a shell of a person and have a low mood most of the time. I have tried a lot of different antipsychotics and even antidepressants and I have not tolerated anything other than Latuda, though. Since I still have hypomanic episodes, suicidal thoughts, and moderate depression, my psychiatrist is switching me from latuda to vraylar next week. Hopefully that drug works and I don’t have to suffer anymore. I don’t think I would take this medication again.Read More Read Less  "

I’ve been taking it only 3 days and feel like a complete zombie. I feel dizzy when I stand up, still had an anxiety attack today and get no joy out of anything.

I had been on Prozac 20mgs for about three years and was doing fine, but I trusted her judgement. It seemed to be working fine for the first month(took it for around 4 months), until I started with horrible episodes of akathisia. I would fall into horrible dread and felt like world was coming to an end. My depression worsened horribly and I was having thoughts of suicide. Around this time I got a new doctor and she began trying to wean me off the medication, going from 40mgs to 20mgs..this was a mistake because I suddenly gained insomnia, completely lost my appetite and would suffer from horrible bouts of panic and anxiety, not to mention the diarrhea and vomiting. Because the withdrawal symptoms were so horrible and strong I decided to go back on the pill at 40mgs but none of these symptoms improved, in fact they got worse. I became so suicidal that the doctor ordered me to lower the dose to 10mgs for 5 days before weaning off completely. Within those those 5 days of taking 10 mgs I began to see improvement. I recognize that this medication might work for some, but it was not the drug for me.   Read More Read Less  "

Eg weight gain spending money unable to focus not sleeping. Mask like face Was hell. When I came off I experienced extreme side affects not sleeping (at all) flickering lights in eyes voices which I didnt have before hallucinations  pain in my body lungs boobs  and chest exhaustion I was also extremely angry and was acting out in public. And people where making fun of me for it  Which I never did before .was off for 6 months after that I couldn't take it anymore and decided to go back on antipsychotics but at a lower dose then before I decided on olanzapine as it didn't have the side affects of extreme insomnia and spending money so I went on 2.5 tablet for 2 weeks then 5 for around a month then 7.5. I found 7.5 too much as I felt sedated and was hungry virtually all the time. It did help my symptoms as I was sleeping again and I slept very well for the first few months of this drug. Then after around 6 months of 7.5 I reduced back to 5 and i have been stable ever since. I have noticed weight gain. More then abilify but I'd rather take that then be on that horrid drug (abilify) again. My mind now feels fragmented and I can't seem to make reasonable decisions anymore becouse of forgetfulness.I also have high triglycerides and and on the verge of hypothyroidism since im also bigger now. im experiencing pain in my knee joints . I am watching what i eat with sugar as i know you can get diabetes on this drug. Its not helping my health but I really can't go back to having no sleep as it will drive me mad.Im also experiencing forgetfulness although i do feel like it has improved my cognition in a way because im sleeping better then what i was on abilify. So at least it is improved. But after a few months it becomes normal and you dont recognise the sleep affects anymore. Since it is a fast acting drug it comes out of your system quicker. So when coming off you will experience side affects quicker. I have tried to reduce  dose to 2.5 a couple of times but the side affects become intolerable. Depression and crying fits flickering in eyes feeling sick  (at first) i havent stayed off long enough on this drug to see what else is in store for me.At this point due to all the damage of previous antipsychotics at a young age on my developing brain It's likely I'll never be able to come off so unfortunately I'm stuck on these drugs.  I also feel like it has caused me to become more impulsive and impatient.with everything including my words and my decisions.i also have no sex drive and dont enjoy much anymore including reading and watching tv becouse my concentration is affected with all that is happened above.  So i feel a bit deflated and depressed .I know it is the drugs causing this as I didn't have this before and also had this with abilify. Minus the depression  If you are young make sure you take all the precautionary ways to avoid becoming sick in the first place sleep no drugs ect before you become a drug filled  sick puppet like me.

My depression lasted years with little to no breaks. I had a manic episode that caused me to seek outpatient care. Where I was diagnosed with psychosis and then prescribed Olanzapine. I’ve been taking it for a little over 3 months. The symptoms I’m experiencing are increase in apatite and weight gain. However if you are an athlete like me the symptoms should be manageable. Olanzapine helps with insomnia as well. During my manic episodes racing thoughts would keep me awake. These racing thoughts and delusional thinking at that have subsided although they haven’t stopped entirely. I like Olanzapine and I don’t think you should be afraid of trying it to help with your mood. It’s a very good mood stabilizer.Read More Read Less

The worst is how, even while tapering off with the help of a professional, I get extremely sick if I stop taking it. Constant nausea and vomiting and intense anxiety attacks that don’t stop until I begin taking it again. Numerous times, I have spent two weeks throwing up nonstop and being bedridden before I gave up and began taking the medication again. To this day I continue to be dependent and addicted to a drug I do not need.

I was getting VERY nauseous every single day

Ok… so eventually in may I start weening down
I was at 10mg
Then 7.5
To 5mg and then 2.5mg

So I did…. I AM HAVING THE WORST WITHDRAWAL 
she never mentioned any of this! I have been sleeping next to a garbage can for 5 days! I am dizzy, shaking, i have the chills and am extremely cold
She told me nobody gets withdrawals 
Last night I googled it (please do research on this drug) and NUMEROUS (a TON) of people had the exact same experience as me and their withdrawal was HORRIBLE! Some said it lasted weeks to months… and they had horrible lingering effects from this drug
This drug has RUINED MY LIFE

Concerning the meds. It makes me dizzy, gives me a headache and my anxiety doesn't get any help from this med. I don't know why my Dr. wants me to stay on it. I can only imagine it is cause i have been taking abilify.

 I had a bad reaction due to a combo of my pcos and this med together. 
One day i woke up at 6 am, i got lightheaded, dizzy and i remember walking towards my bedroom and all of a sudden i couldn't hold myself up 
I fell to my knees for a few seconds and then went face forward. I busted my nose and couldn't get up for a few seconds and when i did there was a small puddle of blood on my floor. 
I have pcos, so i think a cyst on top of my overy ruptured causing my blood pressure to lower and these meds also lower your blood pressure. 
I went to the e.r and they ran tests.

Be careful if you have any condition or other med that already lower your blood pressure.

2281,Rexulti Oral,1/4/2024,25-34,Female,6 months to less than 1 year,Patient,Other,5.0,5,5,5,"READ FULL REVIEW: I had been on Lamictal for my OCD and Bipolar dosorder since I was 12. I continued to experience overwhelming thoughts and manic episodes for most of my life until the age of 25. I went to a hospital for SI and although I had two other meds for depression and ocd, I was at a loss because nothing was working. I realized in the hospital as well I had a severe eating disorder and was able to work through therapy to get to a better point, but I still just wasnt there yet. I had trouble taking my meds consistently and it was really effecting my mood swings. Because of this also my Lamictal gave me a rash and I thought I was back out trying all the meds that previously didn’t work. That was when my doctor recommended REXULTI. I have been on it most consistently than any other med for about 6 months.
Here is why I love this med.
1: I LOVE TO EAT! I was severely malnourished and this med helped me with my lack of hunger cravings that was a result of years of suppressing hunger. This has helped me with my confidence and I can finally work out.
2: MANIA AND HYPOMANIA REGULATED This med works great for regulating my highs and lows, which I have never found my other meds to actually achieve.
3: DOOM IS GONE I hadnt cried in about two months which is my lifetime record. I just was able to handle my emotions better.
4: MISSING 1 DAY DOES NOT EFFECT ME. This one was huge. If I miss a dose I am less likely to fall into a mood swing or episode and therefore have been able to remember and take the following dose instead of missing it due to my illness symptoms. 

Keep in mind that I have copious amounts of therapy as well as two other meds for ocd and depression, with all that in mind, I love this medication.Read More Read Less  "

My first month, I just wanted to eat. I didn't feel hungry. I realized my depression was getting better and I now find laying in bed all day BORING. So, I turned to food. Month 2, I turned that boredom to working out. I'm now in month 3, eating regularly, still working out, intrusive thoughts still like to pop up once a day but it used to be unending.

I'm also taking Wellbutrin, Ambien, Xanax, and Ritalin. Have not needed my Xanax for panic attacks! Wild.

It took a few weeks but it worked in terms of stopping the voices in my head, stopping the paranoia, and ending the delusions/hallucinations. The downside is my weight went from 180 to 265, and I have to take diabetes meds now to control my blood sugar. I have been on the medication for nearly two years, and am considering switching to another drug since I am stable & the side effects are wreaking havoc on my physical health. I am thankful Zyprexa was available when nothing else would  alleviate my break with reality, though. Read More Read Less  "

I haven’t touched psych meds in years because I had such a horrible experience with seroquel before that I didn’t want to try anymore ever again. And I wouldn’t have if it wasn’t for me having a borderline psychotic episode and horrible anxiety from all the craziness that was happening in my life (fiancé was poisoned with pcp, he lost his job due to it so financial issues, and having to go to court against my attacker) that I needed something to calm me down and stabilize me. This did exactly that. Makes me a little bit tired during the day but nothing that causes me to need a nap or anything and honestly it helps with the anti-anxiety portion of my issues. I feel better than ever. I had a little bit of the munchies the first couple nights but I was able to fend  them off and haven’t had them since now.

Within a few months, my weight doubled - from 93 to 186 lbs.  There was no possible way to control my appetite and I ate constantly despite my doctor saying all I needed to do was exercise and eat less.  It made me so sleepy I often slept 16 hrs a day.  Also created cognitive impairment to the extent I became too disabled to work (there were other factors, of course.)  I could no longer enjoy reading, painting, writing, or watching movies because the Zyprex messed up my ability to remember what I was doing.  And I even had periods where I could not remember what I had done or where I had been the previous day.  It did nominally help with auditory and visual hallucinations, and eventually psychosis ended.  Although I think that might have happened on its own, over the 15 yrs.  I feel Zyprexa ruined my life completely.  I will never use it again, no matter what.  Also I was previously a long distance runner, but the weight gain on Zyprexa ended that immediately.  I felt like a zombie for 15 yrs.  When I stopped taking it (with my doctor's knowledge) in 2013 I immediately lost 60 of the 93 lbs I had gained.  But it has been difficult to maintain.  I have since regained my ability to engage in the hobbies I had enjoyed before, and am mostly okay cognitively.

After being on the medication for a month and a half, I didn’t experience any significant improvement which is unusual for this type on medication. I experienced more agitation/restlessness than before which was just unacceptable given how much this medication costs. My MD doc’s Vraylar, put me on another mood stabilizer(won’t say the brand) but it was a generic, 5X less expensive and so far it’s working quite well.

We lowered it to the 1.5MG dose and the twitching went away after a few weeks. I gained over 150 pounds in the first 2 years. Did everything in my power to lose weight and it would never go down. I ended up getting diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, vision problems and really bad anxiety after the 2nd year. I was very healthy prior to this medicine. This medicine didn't even have the warning of diabetes when I started taking it. When I was diagnosed after the 2nd year is when Vraylar added that warning. Once I was at almost 300 pounds is when I decided to call it quits. Doctor weaned me off of it for the last year and I am so glad I am off. Now instead of battling my mental health of bipolar and depression, I am having to fight for my life to stay healthy with all my health issues caused by this medicine.

2350,Caplyta Oral,1/15/2024,35-44,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Bipolar Depression,1.7,1,3,1,"I experienced all the adverse effects. My doctor initiated treatment with an exceptionally high dosage of 42, although lower doses like 10 and 5 are available. Taking one pill at 9 pm on Friday, I felt fine until 10 am the next day. Suddenly, I felt extremely cold, as if my bones might break, displaying severe COVID-like symptoms. The sensation was akin to being intoxicated, accompanied by a severe headache. I managed to sleep at 4 am and slept until noon, taking two days to return to a normal state.

Upon researching, I discovered that the drug was approved at the end of 2019 without a third trial. The available information and data seem insufficient. I believe doctors should not be allowed to prescribe higher dosages until a thorough 90-day trial is conducted. I plan to issue a formal statement to the government addressing this concern.

I am 43 - female. Read More Read Less  "
2351,Caplyta Oral,12/22/2023,45-54,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Bipolar Depression,2.3,3,2,2,"I took one Caplyta around 3 pm yesterday after I picked it up from the pharmacy. That was my first one since my doctor just put me on it. For some reason, he started me on the highest 42 mg and gave me a 90-day supply. Hello, I have to try it out to see if I like it first. So, my poor insurance had to pay $5600 for that 90-day supply. HIGHWAY ROBBERY! About an hour in, I felt nauseous (I forgot to take it with food). I ate some toast, and that went away within about 30 minutes. Then I started to get dizzy and feeling drunk.
I went to bed at 10 pm and still felt this way. I woke up with a severe headache and still feeling drunk around 3 am--12 hours after taking the dose. It's 8 am now, 17 hours after taking it, and I still feel slightly dizzy, but I have an awful headache. I'm not sure if I can continue this. I never get headaches at all, so this isn't very good. I guess I'll try it again tonight before bed and see if that helps. I wish my doctor would have started me on the lowest dose first and not the highest. I sure hope these side effects go away. I can not function, feeling dizzy, drunk, and having a headache. Additionally, I take Lamictal, Adderall XR, and Xanax at night to sleep. Read More Read Less  "

I have really bad insomnia…. And this shit knocks me out! Full six to eight hours no waking up to pee(I got four to six times a night in four hours). Also the first night I was extremely thirsty and peed every ten seconds when I was awake. Anyways, night two way better. No side effects other then it feeling like an elephant tranquilizer. I love it, I’ve never slept so well and I’ve been on the hard stuff…ambien seroquel etc. I am a week into treatment and I feel as if it’s been 6 weeks on any other med I’ve ever tried. Only side effect stand up slowly, which I have to do already, and stuffy nose when I wake up but it goes away shortly.

2354,Caplyta Oral,11/14/2023,45-54,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Schizophrenia,4.7,5,4,5,"Caplyta for me is a game changer. The 42mg strength is too strong after the first week.

Caplyta allows my brain to relax so that the dopamine and serotonin can regulate them selves.

So if you are familiar with muscle relaxers. Caplyta for me relaxed the dopamine and serotonin so they can actually perform within the brain.

I have low serotonin and dopamine which is very active in my bipolar 1 with depressive symptoms.

Was on abilify and then switched to Zyprexa. All I have ever known is depression with bouts of psychosis. More lows than highs.

On Caplyta, I have been able to regulate the highs with the lows. If you can with stand the temperature regulation and paralysis of the first week, you can make it to the other side.

I have asked for the 21mg as I was in bed until 2pm due to leg paralysis. I couldn't successfully get out of bed until 2pm. 

I believe the drug is active for 14-18 hrs and when I took the drug at 8pm. Was asleep by 830pm and my brain was awake by 9am. Could not open my eyes until 1030am. And was not fully active till 2pm.

I am hoping I will be successful on the 21mg and move back to the 42mg as needed.

Caplyta is a game changer. But you need to be in contact with your provider to confirm new symptoms.

Depression is regulated. My only concern is magnesium is an active ingredient and I have a Factor V Leiden.

But I was given a hematologist to confirm previous Factor V and breast and cervical cancer diagnosis.Read More Read Less  "

Since been off it a couple of days now my whole body hurts and is killing me like every bone, joint, muscle, tendon, and vein is hurting. It didn't help me think more clearly or positive. I couldn't think at work, I would just stare in space and negative thoughts flooded my head. People kept asking me if I was okay or ask me whats wrong. It also made me bruise very easily and still am. I did gain weight on this medication and only agreed with my doctor to try it because says doesn't cause weight gain and my doctor knows I refuse to take anything that'll make me gain weight.

I got back to the one i was prior to my schizophrenic start in the early 90's. Lost 18 of my years, but now im happy :)  In my case i had several voices in my head, either helping me, or wanting to be cruel, or other mal adjusted types of conscious behavior. It was like my connections in my head was not connected as for memory concerned, i had big trouble remembering things. Sometimes hard forming sentences (at the end before i finally gave in to drug treatment, as i realized now its time to try something new.)And i dont regret it at all, it was the start of a new life, with the connections in my brain finally working again as they should.  I would recommend others that have trouble with schizophrenia to try this drug. Dont start of with a big dose 20mg, but start with 7.5mg for a week, then if it doesnt work as good as wanted, try 10mg for another week. For me 10mg was enough, but i realize that i might in the future higher the dose. I've been on 10mg for 2 mnths now, and the 10mg keeps working 95%. I sure hope that i dont have to increase the dossage very much in the future, as i hope it will stablelize atleast with a 15mg dossage.  Its very individual how effective the medisine is, from people to people.  In my case i had far too much production of dopamine, and serotonine (neurotransmitters)  So the meds are ""hindering"" the reseptors to use much of the D&S which i produce, and it gives me calm, and makes my brain/mind whole.

Weaned down to lower dose still side effects jaw clenching, constipation, neck and severe back pain. I’m on one 20 mg tablet once a day but still not dealing well with bad side effects, agitation and anger with family. Not to mention the dose at 80 mgs was so awful. Nothing bad a bad review for this medication. Yesterday and one other time I’ve had heart flutters for about 10 minutes it was quite scary. I can’t get into a local psychiatrist and have to go to my nearest city. I’m really scared to continue these drugs together no one is listening to me. I’m feeling depressed and was suicidal a few weeks ago but that has subsided. Not very good at all, also I went from being super angry yesterday morning and then after lunch I felt uncontrollable laughter and talkativeness. Not happy at all with this drug.

2398,Ziprasidone Oral,12/11/2022,25-34,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Bipolar Depression,4.0,4,4,4,One of the few mood stabilizers I can tolerate.  Only side effect was some fatigue/ drowsiness.
2399,Ziprasidone Oral,8/6/2022,,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Schizophrenia,5.0,5,5,5,"I have been taking ziprasidone (geode) 40mg HCL for a while. I have not had a schizophrenic episode yet. I have not had any symptoms relating to psychosis and my paranoia has been controlled. I do have some side effects but I would much rather have side effects than psychosis. I take this at night time before I sleep. 
My first side effect is leg shaking. When I was in a higher dose, I would shake my legs a lot. My psychiatrist said this was restless leg syndrome and prescribed me propranolol. I take 30mg of propranolol and I do not shake my legs. I shake my legs unconsciously but it depends on the day. 
My second side effect is that I sleep a lot. I sleep for maybe 9-12 hours and if I wake up mid sleep I have this uncontrollable tiredness and fall back to sleep. After I take the medication it makes me want to sleep and I sleep for quite a while. I am not able to function if I do not get enough sleep.
My third side effect relates to the second, if I miss a dose I will not sleep at all. Since I sleep 9-12 hours when I take the medication, if I skip it I will not sleep. If I skip my dosage of ziprasidone I will not sleep throughout the night. I will not sleep for two nights straight If I continue to not take it. If I am laying down to sleep without taking the medication there is a moment where my body wants to sleep but the brain does not. My body gets a bit tired but I will continue to be awake. If I skip it again I will continue to be awake till the second night where I will get 4-6 hours of sleep. I will also sweat while I sleep. If I keep going without taking the medication, I will slowly increase the number of hours of sleeping. If I take the medication after not taking for multiple days, I will sleep the entire day until the next day. The body will make up for all the lack of sleep. 
The side effects kind of suck but I have also used it for my advantage when I need to control my sleep. When I have lots of homework, I will stay up and just finish all of it.Read More Read Less  "

I’ve told her everything and also said I’d went to the hospital and said give it four weeks. Again another session four weeks. On august 9, 2021 she’d said stop ziprasidone when she also lower it to 20 mg and go to the E.R. and see what´s happening to you. I’ve told her which she knows I don’t want too go to a psych ward and put me on injections because they’ll think I’m crazy. She said with no interest.(I know I know). They way this pill made me react was crazy I don’t know how the professionals got their licenses which, is WRONG AND DISGUSTING HOW PATIENTS ARE TREATED TODAY LACK OF RESPECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ziprasidone was the farthest worst medications I’ve ever received in my whole life. This medication should be evaluated who can take it and who cannot. Just because it helped many doesn’t mean my body will react the same. We are all different. The medical committee should agree to this. I am working on my anxiety which, I still feel the stomach problems. I’ve done tests they’ve all came out normal. I just want too see from a catscan what is going on. In my perspective I will get better with proper taking care of my anxiety and daily life. In the future I will be a better person.

I should just toss the pills out because I wouldn't recommend it or even sell them because that wouldn't be ethical. I was falling asleep at the wheel. I told my doctor I didn't feel safe so they told me to take half a dosage and I still was having trouble keeping my eyes open at work or behind the wheel.

However, as I am researching the medication I have also been looking at old charts of my bloodwork, and somewhere in the years of 2014-2018 (the entire time I took Latuda) My bloodwork was bad, numbers all elevated. I also have Lupus, and have to watch very carefully if any drug affect that too. I was diagnosed with heart condition called WPW, and I'm starting to think it might be from the this type of drug.

My fiancé literally carried me to bed and I don't remember much afterward.  I brought this to my doctor who in turn said that I should have never been prescribed this and to stop taking it immediately.

I immediately got worse not better. All I could do was think about sad or bad things even things that were so hypothetical it wasn't even funny. For example I have a 10 year old Chihuahua and they live to be 18 yrs old ALOT when taken care of and this was when he was like 8 years old and all I could think about was how bad it's going to be on the day I'm going to have to get him put to sleep and I was crying non stop over it and panicking about it and acting as if the vet was in front of me administering the lethal shot right that second. I kicked my ex Wife out of my house and asked for a divorce because she cheated on me and that was back in 2016 and I was well over it when put back on geodon and had been in relationships with other girls And my ex , Wife wasn't even a care to me but as soon as I started geodon I kept running back the moment I caught her after she lied to me about it MANY times cuz I just had a gut feeling and the reality of realizing every fear I had that I thought I was just thinking crazy and exaggerating things in my head and to realize my gut feeling and everything I was afraid of happening happened that was the worst night and then time of my life and took me while to get over her but all of a sudden I was back to crying over the situation and I was obsessing on it & all day long every day all I did was think about it and play the what if game in my head even though I was over her I was still feeling like it was that night again that I caught her and kicked her out. I couldn't sleep and was eating at most once a day so then my psychiatrist upped my dose of geodon and then things went from really bad to HORRENDOUSLY bad and unfortunately we're still trying to find an antipsychotic or mood stabilizer that will work for me.

I still have those thoughts but I don't hyper focus on them. I'm able to focus on other things instead. My thoughts don't bother me as much. I take 20mg in the morning and 40mg at night. It makes me feel weird about an hour or so after I take it at night, so I take it an hour before bedtime so I go to sleep soon after I take it. It has changed the way I plan my meals. I eat 4 meals a day now, but each meal is 500-600 calories. You have to take Geodon with a 500 calorie meal. It works most effectively when you do. At first I had trouble falling asleep, but my doctor suggested taking 10mg Melatonin 30 min. before bed. It works! When I was taking 40mg in the morning and 40mg at night, I felt very restless.

I was prescribed Geodon 20mg for my bipolar disorder and having frequent mood swings. After about 3 weeks, I wasn’t feeling any better, probably worse than before I started this drug. I stopped cold turkey not realizing the consequences of doing so, my psychiatrist never informed me of the dangers of possible withdrawal symptoms. I should have educated myself more on this drug or at least read the reviews on this horrible drug. I see it does work for some people. So do not get discouraged reading all the negative reviews. My psychiatrist decided I take one weeks worth of 20mg. I feel like I’m going crazy.. horrible panic attacks, constant anxiety. Super depressed. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager, I’m 26. But this is a whole different level of anxiety and depression. I’m also on 25 mg 2 times daily of Lamotrigine, .1 mg twice daily of clonidine. And I was taking 40mg adderall but have recently tried tapering off the adderall Thinking that is a factor to my debilitating anxiety. I’ve been to the hospital 3times already for severe panic attacks and my BP was so high 170/110. I feel like this drug is killing me. I can’t sleep, I’m lucky if I get 2-3 hours of sleep each night. I have 3 little children that need me and I just can’t get out of this dark dark place. I’ve made so many lifestyle changes nothing is easing these symptoms.. And another awful symptom of withdrawal is the uncontrollable body movements (TD). I’m also wondering, me being on this medication for a short period of time, why are my stmptoms so severe and prolonged. Other people that have gone through this, please share your experience and tips on how to deal with withdrawal from Geodon. Does it get better???!?!? Read More Read Less  "

I noticed being more sluggish/ tired, and gets harder to get a good exercise/ sweat while on this. Which frustrates me the most.

It also caused an initial mania / episode of voices before adjusting to it. But once that hump is over, my mind is cleared.

2428,Geodon Oral,1/21/2022,25-34,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Bipolar Depression,1.0,1,1,1,"Avoid this medication at all costs. It will stabilize you from mania without a doubt, but it will be VERY painful. I had constant headaches, short term memory loss, couldn't pay attention to anything, would fall asleep all the time, had really bad akathisia, was hot and sweaty all the time. I was only on 40mg as well and I couldn't stay awake to save my life! Dropped down to only 20mg and had HORRIBLE anxiety in the afternoon because the dose was too low. The drug has a very short half life to boot, so you will constantly feel like you are withdrawing from it which is the WORST PART BY FAR. There are MUCH better medications out there, and the fact they still charge so much for a drug made in 2001 is criminal. It's the WORST atypical antipsychotic in my opinion. It will make you feel awful while you are on it, and even worse should you decide to come off the drug entirely. I cannot stress this enough.  Read More Read Less  "

NO ONE SHOULD GO THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH. Taking this drug at the beginning worked for me was very beneficial. When I missed a dosage because I had to work or slept over at a friends house. It was bad. I couldn’t sleep until I took that med. I was on it for a really long time so my dosage was fairly high. But I’m a red head and red heads always need higher dosages of any medication and since I have been on meds for adhd since age 3 and half-4 and was bullied and harrsed severely in school my depression, and a lot of other stuff was extremely high. So I needed extra dosages of a lot of stuff that worked for me. My doctor who prescribed it knew I smoked weed. Knew I had substance abuse when I was very very young and was born drug addicted. Your not suppose to take that med if u have done a lot of that. Or are still doing them. So around October I got pregnant and had to stop my adhd meds. So they stopped those. I felt better. But they didn’t wanna stop the geodon right away bc how much I acted up. So I’m like ok that’s understandable just wean me off of everything and I’ll just smoke weed. My tolerance was very low for weed at the time because of the hormones of being pregnant. I’m 8 months pregnant now and since 2-3 month of my pregnancy weed had not have the benefits as it used to. A lot of my friends are like this after being pregnant. So I was smoking weed and being on geodon for about a few weeks after the adhd meds stopped. My psychiatrist then informed me that it’s not ok to take geodon anymore because of being pregnant. So she surely stopped it. Didn’t wean me off of it like most medications she just stopped it. And not taking that med once or missing it once and not being able to sleep. Stopping it for good was awful. I didn’t sleep for about 3 months. It wasn’t like a meth withdraw where your it just your joints and vibrations. This was worse. How a cow twitches his muscles to get flies off. It felt like that but made me freak out so mad I couldn’t control it. Also felt like a codeine withdraw as well, (which basiclly opiod withdraw once it hits ur brain) with the constant sweating the clammy ness, throwing up constantly. Yes I was pregnant yes I did have morning sickness. But I did not stop throwing up for a really long time. My OB said it was extreme for me to be this much. Especially because I’m having a boy and they tend to come with less morning sickness. I also had sweating, memory loss, headaches, my skin had this weird thing to it. Where sometimes it would feel as if it was twitching on the outside but tired on the inside when trying to sleep or vise versa. During the day I twitched all day. I had extreme dizziness, fainting, falling. A lot of that. And I came on here because alot of my feelings are not getting validated about alot of stuff at home. So I was like maybe it was one of the meds I’m not taking. Now I have long term side effects. The rapid heart beat, high blood pressure, I now I have extreme diabetes. And To inform yes I am pregnant alot of these are pregnancy symptoms. But mine are extremely high. And they tested me for being pre diabetic when they first found out I was pregnant. And they said I was no where close to even being considered for pre diabetes. My sugar ranges anywhere from extremely low to extremely high. But is normal when I eat sugar. But I also have extreme lock jaw, my pulse is around 130. For even pregnancy that is very high. The memory loss. Blurred vision, fainting falling over, muscle stuff. And I have alerted my OB and been to the hospital about 20-30 times this week with fainting and pain. They tested my baby my urine, did a cat scan for stroke and heart attack and mri. Exrays.ultrasounds. Tested stuff over again. Gave me IVs. They told me I was drinking too much water too. Which crazy because I’m always thirsty. But that’s when it clicked in my head. Everything was fine with baby everything was fine with all my scans. And since this drug aRead More Read Less  "

I was in crisis mode due to the death of my momma and how it negatively affected ALL areas of my life. I have been in mental health treatment since 2017 and while I have a few diagnosis, none of them are classified as a psychosis. I did start cutting again as a way to deal with my loss, I had no appetite, I was barely sleeping and my hygiene went to hell because I could hardly get out of bed.

The psychiatrist over the Behavioral Health Unit was familiar with me as it had been necessary for me to receive acute care at least a half-dozen times since 2017. I was started on Quetiapine in October of 2021. The somewhat high dose I was on in the hospital seemed fine and I was so relieved to have my mind quieted and feel a sense of peace. Now, realize that in the hospital setting one has no responsibilities except to eat, sleep, attend some groups and take our medication. The outside world is blissfully OUTSIDE.

Upon returning home, the dose proved to be way too high as I was literally zombified, etc. Upon seeing my own psychiatrist, he agreed and allowed me to cut my dose by two-thirds and take 200 mg. @ bedtime.

I should let you know that I am diagnosed with Treatment Resistant Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent/severe.

I must admit that my depression is not as severe, I don't cry all the time, I don't spend days at a time in bed, I'm not obsessing over ways to end my life, I haven't felt the need to be hospitalized...HOWEVER, I have balance issues I never had before that have led to 1 mild traumatic brain injury, 1 moderate traumatic brain injury, breaking my nose on 2 different occasions through falling, as well as breaking 3 of my teeth along with several various contusions. IN ADDITION, I have researched and discovered the long-term effects of this medication.

I just met my new psychiatrist, as my much-respected and much-adored former psychiatrist recently retired and returned with his family to Egypt.

I had not shared my symptoms with Dr. Anunobi before he left. He was a tele-health doctor due to the fact that our town is just too small to attract psychiatrists. I personally find it difficult to share over a TV screen AND my doctor had extended my appts. to once every 3 months instead of once a month. I'm not a boat rocker.

Well, I did share with new psych. and he took it very seriously, is weaning me off it starting immediately (Oct. 13) and will be starting me on new med which we will discuss on Nov. 3.Read More Read Less  "

Immediately stopped taking it once I got home and felt much, MUCH better off Seroquel (and other meds I was on) 

The second time was by a psychiatrist. I told him of what happened when I was on it at the hospital, but because I was only on it for about a week he told me that I wasn't on it long enough to know if it works and he put me on 50mg to help with hallucinations, delusions, and to help stabilize my mood (later learned he diagnosed me with Cyclothymic disorder) needless to say it did absolutely nothing good. In fact, while on Seroquel I had a huge 2 hour long psychotic episode as well as worsened delusions and hallucinations and my mood did not improve AT ALL (My mood swings from different extremes in minutes). I can't tell if they got worse on it though, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did. 

Needless to say if it doesn't work once, it probably won't work again. And stand up for yourself if you think you're on the wrong medications or have the wrong diagnosis, speak up! An upside though is that the 25/50mg pills are tiny and very easy to swallow.Read More Read Less  "

An incident involving vibrations from an air conditioner led my nervous system into complete dysregulation where I did not sleep for 2-3 weeks. It was terrifying.

I am now up to 50mg of seroquel, and 3mg Prazosin. These drugs have helped me so much. I have not had any weight gain. In fact - I’ve probably lost weight because I’m finally sleeping and don’t find myself to be as hungry as I was before (when you’re consistently underslept - you’re prone to weight gain).

I am still sometimes concerned about the negative reviews for seroquel, but quite frankly, it’s helping me to return to work, function and live my best life.

I only recently upped it to 50mg and I’m learning that I need to take it much earlier in the evening so that getting up in the morning isn’t so bad. 

Everyone is different. I eat extremely well (mostly meat, fish, vegetables and berries), and I exercise regularly, which I know is all good for my metabolism. My body feels more naturally aligned and well now that I’m sleeping.

If you’re like me - and were worried about weight gain - don’t be, especially if you’re doing the work (EMDR, inner child work, grief work etc.). Shedding all of the old trauma through tears and movement will ultimately support your metabolism, and you might just get the best out of this drug.

A nurse prescribed me some Seroquel as an emergency medication and it helped me fall asleep and stay calm enough to engage more deeply in my trauma healing process. It was part of a holistic healing regimen including massage, acupuncture, inner child work, grief work, somatic therapy, and traditional talk therapy as well. It made me drowsy for the first week or two, but I ended up taking up to 50mg at a time (only when needed), titrating down to 25mg, then 12mg, and now only 6.25 (1/4 of a tablet)!! I'm so happy that I got myself this far in my healing journey, but it did take a lot of effort on my part. 

One tricky part is my insurance only covered me taking 2 tablets at a time, not 1 which was frustrating, but I ended up taking less than ""recommended"" because I didn't want to build dependency. I got myself a cute pill cutter which helped me portion off the medication. Thank you to all the reviewers on here who shared their experiences with me, which I read at the start of my journey.

This experience with this medication 5 months ago led me to completely get off all medications cold turkey and give my brain a break: now I don’t recommend this to anyone. It’s been rough and as a matter of fact I’m starting a new medication tonight after 5 months of no meds.
I found it necessary to share in hopes of helping someone.
I had been on Cymbalta 120 daily for over a year and due to additional Bipolar symptoms Seroquel was added lowest dose, I have it a month.

I couldn't swallow because my tongue was rigid and I drooled and vomitted uncontrollably.

2512,Haldol Oral,9/13/2019,35-44,Male,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Schizophrenia,4.7,5,5,4,"I've been taking 5mg of haloperidol for paranoid schizophrenia since 2012. So far it's worked pretty well. Before treatment I had recurrent distressing thoughts, including thoughts that the FBI and the police were somehow after me. I also believed that some other source other than the broadcasters on T.V. were sending me messages through the T.V. as a means of communication. All of those distressing thoughts went away immediately after I began treatment. The only problem was that for several years I was still an unemployed paranoid schizophrenic. Fast-forward and I now have had a few new decent professional jobs. Over the years, I've noted that people don't always communicate ""normally"" and that maybe it was okay to have some paranoid thoughts and distrust towards others. After all, there are those who display arrogance and resort to indirect commentary. It's uncertainty that's insubordinate to the very sense of who we are as humans. It's only a means for degradation. All it takes is for someone to seem to talk on a tangent and there you have it, you can have your condition again.    I've been sharing some of my concerns with medical professionals. It was suggested that I switch medication. I decided to do that. For seven days I've been taking 2.5mg of Haloperidol and 5mg of Abilify. Last night I made the complete switch to 10mg of Abilify. I've been noting improvement in effectiveness and accuracy at work with a slight increase in sleep disturbances. I've also noted, specifically today: restlessness, irritability, a possible headache, stress and anxiety. All of it seems to ""go away"" or ""improve"" when I'm actively involved in something, or when I'm being productive...    The downside to Haloperidol is that you can actually gain a good deal of weight. I went from a healthy 190 Lbs to 270 Lbs. Yet have lost since with diet and exercise. You also need to watch out for tardive diskenesia, which affects certain manifestations or movements of the mouth or jaw.Read More Read Less  "

After 2 days at recommended dosage I discontinued for 24 hours then restarted at 1 mg/12 hours which made a much more acceptable dose without the overdose symptoms. At 1 mg dose patient slept comfortably with only minimum symptoms of aggressive delusional behavior.  I STRONGLY advise healthcare and prescribers to start at a low dose and increase if needed. We learned the hard way that our patient was overdosed via hospice nurse, thankfully we corrected the over-medicating hospicenurse before our hospice patient died.

He has CP and is permanently disabled, confined to a wheelchair. Once he saw that they were going to IV him; he panicked, his arms flew around in fear. They said they were going to give him ""a little something"" to calm him, which ""they would feel comfortable administering to a child if the need arises"". LIARS. I watched helplessly as they injected him with what was described to me as the lowest dosage possible. The ER staff does not give a f___ about their patients. This was a way to make their job easier. They didn't want to deal with what THEY perceived as a problem. So the bastards drugged him. IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO HURT ANYONE.   Much later - when he was admitted and escorted upstairs to a room, his sleep was disturbing. He struggled to rest. He made sounds in his sleep that never happened before. By morning: his face, lips, and tongue were so swollen he could not swallow, eat, drink, or speak! His breathing was compromised, he had involuntary facial movements, tremors, tongue thrusting, and his mouth hung open as he drooled. Not only was he ill and needed treatment but now all of this!? What the F___K! Day 2 the swelling had come down considerably yet he still had ""lockjaw"", more drooling, and his body was stiff and rigid. Day 3 his mouth was no longer was affected, however his food/liquid intake had to be modified as he was still having issues with swallowing. His body remains stiff; neck appears ""stuck"" to one side, cannot turn over in bed, cannot feed himself with a fork due to weakness, shaking, and tremors. Cannot move his left arm nor do any of the small movements he used to do before this drug. It has been 8 days and he still suffers. Dr. says this isn't permanent and will eventually subside.

In short, it works for me but I do not recommend it if you have other options. It has smoothed out my mood and helped to keep me from bouncing to extremes. If I miss a dose, 36 hours later I am deep in my negative feels, it usually goes away in a day. It has also affected my life more than any other drug I've ever taken. My first round of side effects included tremors, poor appetite, occasionally a shiny rainbow effect but only briefly. Oh, this is important, my acne has gotten just awful. I've always had some acne but now its like a medical condition. I quit drinking and smoking, not of my own accord, and just drink tons of water all the time. Basically it filled the space usually occupied by my vices. Now that some time has passed, I have a new set of side effects. I still get shaky sometimes but not that bad, I can't drink even if I want to- it doesn't taste good anymore and I can't make myself drink-I do miss it. My appetite came back and I have gained 30 pounds in the last year. I experience what I call suggestive hallucinations. I constantly interpret things as other things when skimming while driving or on the move. Noise often turns into music, if I lay on my side so only one ear is hearing, I can interpret the dryer or dish washer or furnace as actual music. I would get off of lithium right now but I'm afraid I would go crazy and unalive myself or others or something else drastic. We are stuck together until I learn how to cope with myself and my life and find security and balance.Read More Read Less  "

I was fighting mental illness for nearly seven years since I was 13. I cut myself and would sometimes beat myself until the area turned purple and yellow.  I've attempted suicide more times than I can count in hope of succeeding, and flew 1800 miles alone to San Francisco  with no way back and nothing much other than the clothes I was wearing. My sole purpose to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge when I arrived. However, it took three more hospitalizations after that before I was started on lithium. Lamictal was added and finally Effexor. Lithium did a great job while to side was right. It did best at controlling the manic side, but I didn't have the mood swings I had before. The other meds further helped with the depression side. I don't know why lithium is not prescribed more often. It's a great medication and I don't know where I'd be without it. Sideffects seem minimal and I've been taking it for over two years now. I think it makes me more sleepy, but I think the others do as well. I have to be careful in the heat and make sure I replace electrolytes, and watch caffeen intake and be careful with ibuprofen. But it's wonderful. I know meds work differently for everyone, but if your like me and tried dozens of meds with no results, then it's definitely worth talking to your doc about it. And find a good doc. A good doc will listen and allow you to suggest things about your treatment and meds and not force you to change meds or force you take something that you don't want to. I hope this helps to all our there struggling. Don't ever give up hope. :)Read More Read Less  "

Spent two years with back doctors, meanwhile my weight ballooned. I went from 200 (already overweight) to 275. At 275 I developed hight blood pressure, heart disease, rashes, lung problems, and my back pain was excruciating and constant. I stopped taking Divalproex, started a number of heart meds, and my cardiologist supervised a diet, and now I am down to 170. I will always have a bad back now, but it is better than it was.

I was trying to speak and my tongue was poking out in really weird ways and my whole body was just doing so many weird things and I had no control.

Along with that I have been taking Lamictal, benztropine, tegretol, tenormin, and ambien CR. So far i feel much different from the way I used to feel on saphris or abilify for antiphychotic meds and also got put in hospital when I always felt wide awake and couldnt eat. I can eat now and the only reason I made satisfaction a 3 out of 5 is that I just started and cant figure out how well this is helping me. I still feel alittle anxiety and misplaced energy but at least this drug does not make me feel sleepy all the time and it also feels like my brain is not dumbed down. It actual gives me a sense of well being which I have not had in ages, even though I have been prescribed anti-depressants in the past. It has more effectiveness and than any of the other meds.

In my case Psychiatry was weaponised by the very wealthy and influential psychologist mother of a former girlfriend. I nearly died from the effects of this medicine and was permanently damaged. This drug has been used as an interrogation device and chemical restraint at secret U.S.A. extraterritorial rendition prisons. This drug lacks efficacy in the treatment of disorders and is what influences school shooters to shoot, maim and kill.   This drug does similar damage to all mammals and its knowledge should be allowed to expire from human consciousness. It is nothing more than a by product of herbicide production and as such highly promotes advers sentitivity to even the minutest presence of herbicides. It promotes endocrine imbalance and erosive damageto the metabolic, muscular,cardiac, frontal lobe  and vascular systems.   This drug similarly effects both healthy and purported mentally ill individuals in an identical fashion.   Although there may be some individuals who will claim efficacy or lack of action there are some among them who are simply deceiving the psychiatric community by not taking it and claiming they have because they SO FEAR THE EFFECT that they believe avoidance is justified. This drug has NO CORE EFFECT.  This drug is a psychiatrists excuse to chase side effects as if they were symptoms of a disease. It is the pivot point of a debauched charlatanistic quackery and all who hail it as anything positive should be expelled from medicine and punished by incarceration for a minimum of six months of actual consecutive days.Read More Read Less  "

It's the only drug, after dozens of illicit and legally prescribed drugs.

Strong enough to have a failed attempt.
I was given it 0.25-0.5mg... 1mg. On top of Sertraline 100mg after 4 months with no improvement. I was only 16 years old. This drug, not only did not work. It gave me ""Akathisia"" which is why I attempted suicide. (It also changed my brain obviously) A permanent 5HT-7 receptor antagonist. Glad my brain grows, heals and creates new pathways.
Risperidone along with most ""Anti-psychotics"" should be SAVED for the dangerous institutionalized. In my opinion. There are many other more, safe, drugs with less side effects, and the same efficacy for most conditions. But hey, I'm not a Dr. !!

I took risperidone for around 5 years and while the medicine does work, the side effects are extremely bad.

Aripiprazole doesn't make the paranoid thoughts go away but it does make them less anxiety inducing and easier to deal with. It's been a huge relief. I no longer dread going to school and being looked at and perceived by other people. It's made it easier to socialize and enjoy my friends' company again. I also happen to be autistic and it has made the irritability part of sensory overload subside however not the pain and exhaustion.

I tried taking it with CBD and CBG with it and that went horribly. It send me into my mood dysregulated state again and I had panic attacks over little things. I also kept shaking. I still take CBD to sleep at night but I don't recommend taking CBD when these meds are more active. Apparently CBD/CBG messes with the same serotonin transmitter that this medication effects.

I have no lows, and I no longer think of suicide at all. I am able to accomplish tasks in my daily life with out it being a laborious chore. I am sleepy on this medicine, but I can tell it’s slowly fading away. I take it with dinner and it helps me fall asleep. If I take it in the morning, I can’t drive safely, as it makes me drowsy. Any flying off the handle simply doesn’t happen on this drug- I am able to remain calm in most situations. Sometimes I wonder if it’s muting my emotions too much, but I don’t miss feeling uncontrollable. I also don’t miss work due to feel “ill” anymore. Overall, my mind is back to where it was when I was 17- crisp, clean, and normal. My emotions are much steadier and I am able to lead a far more normal life on this medication than on any SSRI. Somehow this was able to lift a soul crushing depression and the stiff neck/light nausea is the trade off.

Basically I found it difficult to concentrate or get anything done, despite not having ADHD. I could go a whole workday accomplishing absolutely nothing, which caused serious problems for me. 

Then my doctor added abilify as an adjunct to lithium and lamotrigine. It’s been life-changing. I am me again, and I have not felt 100% like me in a very long time. I don’t know if I just had lingering mild depression before or what, but I can wake up in the morning, be productive at work, keep my house clean, and feel more at ease in social situations. I am dressing more nicely and doing things like doing my hair, which I used to enjoy but couldn’t be bothered to do for years.

Stopped being able to find words to create sentences leading to not having any conversations. 24/7 depersonalization. 20 pound weight gain. Stiff painful muscles and joints.

Eventually I woke up one morning and decided I wanted to kill myself, so that evening I took about 60-90 mg of it all at once. Started flipping tf out, my heartbeat was erratic and super high, and then I told my family and was rushed to the hospital.

I had the worst tremors, restlessness, fainted thrice and it triggered attempted suicide. The doctors didn’t change the medication even after the side effects. One night, I had this strong urge to jump off a building, craving for the feeling of standing on an edge. I asked to be driven to A&E. We tried different meds afterwards but they mainly gave me intolerable tremors and some were too expensive- like cariprazine (a new drug).

Would still be on this garbage if I didn’t ask for months to try coming off of it. Developed a gambling addiction, had worsening depression and multiple suicide attempts, and developed tardive dyskinesia because of this medication. It’s no coincidence that almost every aspect of my life has gotten better since coming off of this horrible medication… have had 0 suicidal ideation and have had many more happy and productive days since coming off of it in June than the entire past decade beforehand - no exaggeration at ALL.
don’t want to get into how bad my gambling addiction was but it is once again no coincidence that the urge to gamble being the only thing on my mind all day every day for years suddenly disappeared
writing this because although I am now scarred for the rest of my life due to these experiences and strong emotions felt throughout, along with now having to live with tardive dyskinesia, I am hoping that at least one person who is considering taking Abilify will see this and reconsider.Read More Read Less  "

I almost died, my throat closed off, muscles seized up, my blood pressure shot sky high, and my heart rate was 110.  This medication should be administered in SMALL doses under medical supervision.  He was on this unit 3 days, shot in the ass with the injection and sent home with diphenhydramine and more halidol 10mg (not sure on the strength) and the messed up thing is that he still thinks someone is trying to kill him and is watching him.  The only time i can get him halfway back to normal is when he is at my house with me and family.  But getting a paranoid person to leave their house is almost impossible.

I have Trichotillomania too and because Lithium has antianxiety properties too, I stopped pulling y hair completely after having been mostly bald for the 5 years prior. That said there are some significant drawbacks; I do feel sedated a lot of the time. If for whatever reason I stop taking lithium (whether I am aware that I missed a dose or not) I end up in tears the next day, panic-y and much more agitated than normal. I also get very jittery if I stop taking it long enough. I'm talking about cold turkey though, not about decreasing the dose in increments. Dry skin and mouth but it's not sever for me.

Also, she never told me I had been diagnosed as schizophrenic but she did tell my family, without my permission, even though I was over 21 at the time.     This drug is HELL.

Also, be careful of your liver while you take it: don't drink at all and avoid acetominophen.

I began to crash in to a deep depression and put my children in family care of my loved ones, gave my puppy away to someone?, fell asleep for 3 days straight and when I awoke called my psychiatrist who immediately started me on Trilafon. Typically I would have been in the hospital within days and for no less than a 6 week visit.  I called my psychiatrist everyday and he monitored my progress over the phone reassuring me all the way.  Within a week I could feel my thoughts clear and the physical distortion that pulled at my (head/brain) also affecting my eyesight and heavy depressive symptoms including manic and depression at once where I wanted to sleep for days while I also wanted to socialize endlessly on the computer.  By two weeks I was back to ""normal"" and functioning perfectly caring for my 1 year old and other 2 young children by myself.  After about 3 months I lowered this med down from 12 mg to 2 mg.  I have stayed on 2 mg during the rest of the year.    It is Spring again, I have had some symptoms that could lead in to this again. I have raised my dosage to 4 mg to see if this offsets the nauseated feeling I have; which often times is a first symptom for me that I need my meds adjusted.

During a forced admission to ICU when he visited a psychiatrist to talk about his MS (we were managing okay), he was started on this drug (37.5mg) & discharged into the community after 3 shots. All passion for living has gone completely. His depression is now so much worse than it has ever been, gained 13kg in a month, aching muscles despite lack of use. It is now almost 3 months since his final injection (we sent him out of the country to avoid the compulsory treatment order) & he is spending 20 hours a day in bed, can't manage to self care or exercise whereas he was previously a charismatic energetic skateboarder who mentored younger kids and exercised 5 hours a day. Bloods show tripled prolactin levels, elevated lipids & cholesterol damage. Although we are still hoping for some improvement, we can say without doubt that this drug has destroyed my sons life for more than 6 months, & that was only 3 injections.

He thought our city was being poisoned by the water. While at our house he was asking if we had any guns.  He was so depressed, we were fearful of what he might do. He went back to his house to get some clothes. While there, he took all of his pills trying to commit suicide. When I went to check on him. I found him with pills scattered all over the floor and said he took most of them. I called 911. He spent 3 weeks in a hospital in Spokane, WA.

I was in psychosis from the substance abuse and untreated bipolar. I needed the antipyschotic. It worked well to help me get back to reality. I experienced pretty bad side effects: rapid weight gain, major ticks and uncontrolled body movements, saliva gathering at creases in mouth, body core overheating without notice, extreme lethargy. But! I came back to reality during my seven months on the drug. And sixty five pounds later I was happier fat and sane than skinny and insane. It stabilized my mood, eased the delusions, started the brain chemistry back on track and allowed me to think again.  I had brain fog.  I moved onto Invega a second generation of Risperdal from what I was told with far less side effects.  I'm glad I was not on it very long.  As far as antipsychotics go, one must be aware of the potency and how strong they can be as far as side effects. Please take precautions ie avoid heating up as I did not realize how I could suddenly heat my core and hit the ground.  But  you can take other drugs for the ticks and it really worked on the psychosis for me. I toughened up on this drug. It made many I went onto the past six years seem tame... Relativity... and sanity. It did work. It hurt and I got fat but I got better. Read More Read Less  "

And it often leads to suicide due to misdiagnosis and increases or changes in medication.  For people without schizophrenia, upto 70% of people will develop this extrapyramidal damage.  Never take any antipsychotic if you have any condition with low dopamine such as ADHD.   This med blocks dopamine receptors and it feels like the 7th level of hell.

Once on Haldol dec shot, over the past year she has been on it, almost all delusions and hallucination have lessened or stopped.  Occasionally now she talks to her ""people"" when alone or when she thinks no one is looking, but this is so minor, and is almost unnoticeable, compared to how psychotic she used to be. For a year now, she goes out: shopping, to movies, on vacation, etc. She works part time. She did gain about 30 lbs, and has occasional muscle pain that a dose or two of over the counter Benadryl has always handled.     Prior to the dec shot, while unmedicated or on other medications, she was on and off psychotic for 2.5 years talking to invisible people almost 24/7, or screaming until her voice was gone, staying in her room for days, if she did go out, she would yell at strangers thinking she could read their minds, she was paranoid and delusional about her step father and called the police on him 100 times in one year. She didn't want to work, and if she tried, she would get fired when the psychosis kicked into high gear. That all changed on Haldol, the weird behavior stopped, with continued improvement over the past year until she seems pretty normal almost 100% of the time. She has held two successful part time jobs.    She does NOT know she is mentally ill (anosognosia), but she doesn't question why she is getting the shot, if she hadn't been arrested and force hospitalized, she probably would never have agreed to the medicine, but she continues to take it now monthly. Life went almost back to normal in my house because of this medicine and my daughter is her sweet self again. The years of psychosis that almost destroyed our family are over.

Then the radio discussed what was on my mind. After being taken to the mental ward by the police which intercepted me on my way to the CIA they gave me haldol. Like magic the tv and radio stoped talking to me. There were no more voices and thank GOD no more gun men hallucinations. So for the cons. Restlessness was the main side effect. I deal with this by walking around town or pacing. This drug does not make you lazy and  I would recommend this for anyone hearing voices and seeing things.I took risperdone for a couple weeks because of the restless side effects from haldol. Risperdone gave this other guy I know boobs and it makes you fat. Worse than that the tv and radio started sending me messages again. Risperdone did not work at all for me.

It isn't a cure, but it has helped an awful lot and anyone out there who is experiencing this, I say ask your doctor about it! I'm still alive! :) It was the least expensive of all the meds I tried too.

The true issue is preventing manic episodes.  Valproic is one of only 3 meds that do that well, and also stop them during a manic phase.  The meds work great for both!  I have been on and off them due to side effect concerns.  They are NOT good for your liver.  Your liver is a super organ that does so many things for you.  I have been off this med for over a year now.  I have no depression and no manic episodes.  Getting ALL nutrients, exercise, adequate sleep and avoiding STESS is key.  Bi-polar is not a disease, it is a nutrient deficiency that causes imbalances in neurotransmitters!  People dealing with ""bi-polar"" need ALL nutrients and it will go away.  These meds are invaluable to bring a manic episode under control, however, they due not ""cure the disease"".  The cure is nutrients...ALL of them!  The key nutrients for the neurotransmitters for bi-polar are: FOLATE (Not, absolutely not folic acid! Never consume folic acid!!), CHOLINE, IRON, B6, B12 all amino acids, & MAGNESIUM. Research on the net food sources for them, and consider supplements.  However, 99% of all ""vitamin supplements"" are not vitamins.  Even the ones at health food stores!  They are pharmaceutical grade analogs (PGA's).  They are horrible for your body, cause cancer, and do not work in the same way as REAL vitamins from REAL food.  If you research PGA's and how they make them and from what you will be horrified!  Do not put them in your body!  Instead, research ""real food source vitamin supplements"" and choose a good one.  The one I selected is from Sunwarrior company because it had the adequate levels and correct ratios of B vitamins.  I make a shake every morning with Gold Standard Whey protein powder, Twinlabs brewer's yeast, Spirulina, 1cup oatmeal softened in hog water, 1 frozen bannana, empty the herbs & supplements caps into it.  I eat only whole, non-gmo, real food. That's all nutrients in a glass!Read More Read Less  "

I have been on the drug consistently for over a year in a half.  In regard to mood stabilization, I have not experienced a hypo-manic episode since the onset of treatment.  I have, however, experienced many depressive episodes.  I don't attribute this to the medication.  After a trial and error phase with my prescriber, we found that Latuda works the best with my depression.   The only side effects that I regularly face is extreme thirst and excessive urination.  I was taking my dose with dinner, shortly before bedtime and my sleep patterns were erratic, waking up around 4 to 5 times a night.  Now I am taking my dose with breakfast, I am still thirsty and urinating frequently, however I am not trying to sleep so it's a win in that category.

I also take lorazepam, and compazine to help combat symptoms during the day time. This is my evening medication. Not providing dosages, or recommending this for anyone as everyone's body is different and what does well for you might not do well for me, and vice versa. 

All I am saying is I am having less periods of brief psychosis, and I am actually resting. It's quite the most amazing thing. If you're on here looking because you're starting this new, and you're scared -- please consult your doctor and pharmacist about your concerns rather than WEB MD. At the very best at least use a peer reviewed website. While this anecdotal stuff might corroborate your fears, or even provide you some comfort, you will not know how it works for you until you take it. Its much smarter to consult the professionals.

One of the symptoms I had that I know that were already reported included anxiety and sometimes depression, but the strangest one I had was very irrational and violent behavior, and I'm not talking about typical and common temper tantrums, as I was only 9 years old taking this; this behavior of mine included actual tantrums out of nowhere and with no apparent cause, writing stories about death, playing violent online games while laughing at it, and casually talking about death at the dinner table--all without me realizing doing it. I've even attempted to run away from home and cause self-harm on myself. Luckily, my mom immediately got me off this medication. At the time, I was also showing obvious signs of autism, but today, I am now considered on the spectrum--higher functioning. I know what happened to me back then, and I know it sounds like fiction just from a drug causing all this odd behavior, but it happened. It still scares me to this day, and I don't know what the heck triggered it, but at least I need to know it's all in the past and over with. The only thing I'm still concerned about it is exactly WHAT caused this rare behavior, but I'm not trying to think about it too much. I know this drug has been giving some patients behavior problems, but mine was definitely weird and abnormal behavior. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is likely to have a mood/other mental problems.Read More Read Less  "

I walked in docs office and within 1 minute of me being in the room she decided to prescribe this medication.  She did not test me and non of my tests in my 47 years of life mentioned me being bipolar.  At the time I was on low dose of generic adderal.  I was actually feeling good.  Seeing this doc was at the request of family doc to regulate anxiety meds. I expressed my discomfort vehemwntly... she was condescending and demanded I give it a try.  I have been all screwed up since.  While taking the Depakote I hade mega migraines, slept constantly, totally ignored my daughter and the rest of my life... I did not care.  I was depressed.  My acid reflux that had completely gone away while on the affexor was back in spades.  Also was my diarhia.  My skin crawled like something was trying to get out.  I heard things that were not there.  My dreams were all kinds of scary to creepy.  These symptoms started slow and just got worse and worse.  I let the doc know, her answer was always to give it time.  My family doc and pharmacist stayed that after two weeks I should see improvement not feeling worse more and more.  When I had 2 or 3 pills left from the 30 day bottle I had had enough... I hated missing so much time with my daughter among other things.  The doc had one of her nurses call me and tell me to continue with these pills again and I told the nurse that I was not continuing. She said she would talk to doc..and when she got back with me the nurse said the doc really wanted me to continue.  I said I am not seeing her again I want to see another doc.  I quit taking them started feeling so very much better almost immediately but it has been about 6 months and I still feel some residual affects.  What did this medication do to me?  I am scared.

I also take additional meds. I was prescribed Risperdal starting at 3mg upped to 6mg over time which really helped my symptoms but started severe weight gain. Very unfortunately, I had to stop taking it because of the hangover it gave me the next day. I was so tired I couldn't move. The day was worthless. I felt like I couldn't even walk to the kitchen I was so tired. I almost felt like I was drunk. Forget going out and running errands, This drug knocked me out for the following day completely but I needed it for my symptoms, so I started taking it every other day so at least I would have a few days a week when I did not feel completely wiped out. Then my Dr prescribed Latuda which I take now instead with good results. Risperdal worked for me when I needed it. And I needed it badly. It was the side effects over time that took their toll. I still keep my prescription of Risperdal because it worked so well for my hallucinations. I keep it for backup in case the Latuda stops working. I don't have my auditory or visual hallucinations any longer, I believe that is because of the length of time I took Risperdal and the high dose. The Latuda is just babysitting what the big guns did. To be clear, my auditory hallucinations were severe, like there would be times I would be in the fetal position on my couch for the entire day crying guttural sobs wishing they would stop, but there was nothing I could do, nowhere I could go.

I think for a lot of people the reason it works is that it inflicts pain and when you're focused on the pain you can't argue or defend yourself.  The thing is, this medicine did nothing to remove or reduce hallucinations or delusions, I was having them when i had them regardless of dose (I've taken anywhere from 1-6mg/day), I was just busy focusing on the pain so didn't complain as much about the other symptoms.Read More Read Less  "

The first two weeks were so bad, I didn't eat anything except 2 dry crackers per day, lost alot of weight. I switched to taking it at night and therefore began to sleep through some of the sickness. After 2 weeks everything started to improve. No more sickness. I finally started to feel really good again and more confident in my work and home life. I was having difficulty sleeping so once the sickness wore off I switched back to taking it in the morning. I sleep like a baby now and when something bad happens I just take a breath and go at any difficulties with a clear mind and with ease. I am taking 50mg once per day. It has saved my life.

Sertraline has definitely been effective for me in balancing out my moods. I was taking the highest dose for about two years along with Buspirone. I stopped for awhile and went down hill, emotionally. I am now getting back onto a smaller dose of sertraline 50mg daily, which I know is a good start. The only negative is I’ve dealt with constipation a lot throughout my life, however, I did not have worrisome gastrointestinal issues or anal fissures until recently; which I feel was brought on due to my age and the medication. My daughter, however, also started on sertraline and now also has an anal fissure that won’t heal and stomach issues. She is 12 years old. I think that although sertraline does have positive effects, if you are of color, I would be careful as this medication can speed up gastrointestinal issues and or inflammation in the anus and stomach area.

2972,Fluvoxamine Oral,11/16/2023,19-24,Female,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,4.3,5,5,3,"Let me begin this by saying, I will never ever tell anyone about this medicine. You will never hear a recommendation for this come out of my mouth about Luvox. 

That said- this medication is highly effective in treating anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. At 12 years old, I was put on this medication because I had a severe counting compulsion. I am now 20 years old. I have taken 150 mg the entire time I’ve been on it. It completely curbed any OCD compulsions, it is very effective in blanket treating anxiety as well. 

At 21 years old now, I had decided a couple months ago that I wanted to transition to something lighter that treats anxiety and depression and can be taken more long term (with pregnancy, other medications, etc). Fluvoxamine is not compatible with more than about 10 medicines. 
My psychiatrist warned me of the withdrawals, prescribed me an as needed medication to treat any withdrawal symptoms, and we developed a taper plan. I tapered fine, experienced no symptoms during that time, and was very hopeful I was going to be unaffected. Wrong! 

Approximately a week after my last dose the withdrawals began- debilitating vertigo, nausea, so so so irritable, emotional, the vivid dreams were horrifying, extreme exhaustion but inability to sleep. Things that are 100% research and documented to be related to Luvox withdrawals. There isn’t even any brain space to know if whatever Luvox was treating was affecting you because you are suffering. This lasted right at 4 weeks for me. I am now happily on Wellbutrin and regulated. 

Simply for the withdrawal someone would have to go through to get off this medicine- it should be ban. I highly highly encourage you to read literature on this medicine. The black box warning, the reasons it is banned in other countries. Lastly, I encourage you to look up the association of the Columbine shooter and this medication. He was 3 weeks into withdrawals cold turkey from this medication when he acted upon his school. 

There HAS to be something better than this for OCD, anxiety, etc. Read More Read Less  "

They were severely debilitating and occurring weekly. Each incident lasted about 4-5 days and then I would get another. This went on for many years. The doctors simply gave me strong muscle relaxers and pain killers. After so many years, at the age of 40, my doctor prescribed Nortriptyline. I took 10 MG everyday for 2 weeks, then increased it to 25 mg. In the end I was taking the maximum, 150 mg (50 mg 3 times per day) everyday. I am now 67. 4 days ago I took my last pill after cutting back over a 2 month period. In the beginning, I had sound hallucinations, mostly in large groups of people or when there was a fan or motor noise I could hear voices. I put up with it because it was mild and did not happen all the time. Eventually, they went away (or I learned to ignore them). In all those years, I had only two episodes of back spasms and they were never as severe as before and went away overnight. I had great sleep every night. The pills made me a little drowsy with dry mouth during the day but they worked so well to fix the issue that I was ok with the mild side effects which went away. After so many years of taking them I was nervous about quitting but I have not had any muscle spasms and the withdrawals are not severe because I cut back very slowly over 2 months. I am having great difficulty sleeping though and it worries me as I become a real basket case without my regular sleep. However, I had a good sleep today for the first time: restful, rejuvenating, and deep. I hope I make it through this. The reason I quit is because I felt the pills were ""holding me back"" from achieving things that are hard to accomplish.

Yes, I am living every man's worst nightmare and in his 20s at that. Before I was on Pregabalin (also known as Lyrica) but this made me extremely anxious and drowsy, to the point where I felt everything was a hallucination and felt drunk all the time as well as regular panic attacks. I was then prescribed 20 mg's of Nortriptyline which came in the form of two pills in the evening. After 2 months on it, my pain was gone. I could finally do 'activities' with the wife and not feel like Mike Tyson had just given me an uppercut to the taint. Side effects were minimal, at first I had some really wild dreams but that was about it. The Nortriptyline also helped with my General Anxiety, which is definitely a bonus.

A few years later I somehow pinched a nerve. Symptoms returned but I was recommended I increase my dosage to 50mg/day. A few more months later (and being very cautious in that regard) no more burning pain down my entire right side of the family heirlooms. Side effects did appear at around this dosage. Constipation is an issue but this can be negated with fibre-based supplements or dried fruit such as Apricots if you need things to move in a hurry.

Small side note, whilst generic brands are equally effective as the named brands, the generic brands have no coating on the pills which taste horrible. Also, be careful if you're on the 10mg pills. If you drop them, they disappear into the void never to be seen again as they're very small. 

This medication is a form of Antidepressant, known as a tricyclic antidepressant so your mileage on this medication may vary. It is, however, a less 'aggressive' antidepressant than modern SSRIs.Read More Read Less  "

I suffered all my life and finally at the age of 73 I got relief. SSRIs never worked for me. I have had no side effects at all on Nortriptylene at the one year mark.

It's been a lifesaver truly. We moved to 50mg a couple months in and I've been migraine free for over two years. I still get the aura and blindspot like I always did right before the migraine and now I can take some OTC ibuprofen and have little to no pain. I still feel worn out afterwards like my body experienced the migraine but I don't have to pause my life anymore and I don't have to fear losing my job because of migraines.

3001,Nortriptyline Oral,10/28/2022,65-74,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Other,3.0,3,5,1,"I was prescribed this for chronic migraines. I'd been taking a combination  of acetaminophen/ibuprofen  3-4 times daily. My neurologist told me I was experiencing ""rebound headaches"" from taking so much medicine. He told me to immediately stop taking them, although he didn't suggest anything else to help me that I could afford.(Newer migraine meds such as Nurtec and Ubrelvy, aren't  covered by Medicare, and would cost me $800-900/month out-of-pocket.) 
I started with 10mg daily and worked up to 30mg by week three. During that time, I sat in a dark room during the day; was in too much pain to sleep well at night; and literally did nothing but the basics due to debilitating pain. 
I eventually started to experience less pain, which I attribute to stopping the OTC meds that were causing the rebound headaches.
After another month of being on the nortriptyline I decided that the side effects were worse than - or at least as bad as - the headaches.
I was so tired during the day, I could barely motivate myself to do anything. I experienced muscle weakness to the point where I could no longer perform simple tasks like carrying a laundry basket or a gallon of milk. The dry mouth was so intense, I'd wake up during the night unable to swallow; my tongue felt like it was coated with lint; my breath was horrendous; and my sense of taste was off.in addition, I started craving sugar. It got so bad that I couldn't control it and ended up eating cookies, candy and pastry throughout the day  As a result, I gained 13 lbs. in 10 weeks; and my glucose went from 91 to 128. Then there was the constipation, another horror story. 
As of this writing, the migraines are only sporadic, and less severe than they used to be. If I feel a headache coming on, I take an OTC sinus and congestion medicine and it goes away completely, something I wasn't  able to achieve with my other OTC combination. And I haven't  had to take them more than once a day if I need them at all.
I've only been weaned off nortryptiline for a couple of days, and I'm feeling much better. Soon after cutting back on my dosage, the tiredness, muscle weakness and sugar cravings are significantly diminished.Read More Read Less  "

It was prescribed to me after trying 3 other antidepressants (paxil, terazodone and mirtazapine) that didn't work for me horrible experiences. I litterally felt like i was losing my mind. I had to stop the mirtazapine cold turkey last Sunday. I started with 10mg of nortriptyline which I finally slept intermittently but slept. But i don't know if it was because i didnt sleep the night before and that's why it worked a little bit.  I thought it would provide more of sedating effect but it didn't which my doctor had mentioned that to me. She  prescribed it for anxiety and insomnia due to my symptoms lingering after getting the COVID variant on 7/24 took paxlovid and rebounded the following week after taking that drug. I have lost 18 plus pounds since getting the virus and still suffering from loss of appetite. Dont get me wrong i could of stood to loose some weight, but not like this. I have been out of work since August 15th and now on FMLA. I hate taking western medicine and still confused on why my doctor put me on this. Because I read its primarily used more for nerve pain. I told her I didn't want to be on anymore antidepressants but she said it wasn't considered a antidepressant only at the higher doses. I upped the dose to 20mg last night and hoped I would get the sedating effect and sleep, but it didnt. I had to end up taking 10ml of liquid benadryl 4 hours later to help me get some sleep. I may have slept 2 or 3 hours and now I'm awake with dry mouth and feeling nauseous and tired. My doctor said I can gradually up my dose up to 50mg. I hope that won't be the case for me because  I have a low tolerance for medication. I am going to try 30mg tonight in hopes that it will finally work for sleep. But then again it may work because of me not sleeping last night. I have got to get back to work and start feeling like myself again. I would like to see more positive reviews about this drug. But I keep reading bad ones and getting discouraged. But like people have said on here that this medication may not be for everyone. Because at this point I am starting to lose hope that this will not work for what it was prescribed for. So please someone out there, let me know that there is hope on the horizon. And that I will start to see the  light at the end of tunnel. And be able get off this medication roller coaster that I have been on for 2 months now.Read More Read Less  "

I was only prescribed 10 mg a day for occipital nerve pain and two doses in was enough to make me lose my mind, just two doses. I can echo much of the side effects mentioned by the other horror stories here, including jacked up thinking, more depressed, insanely anxious, sleepy beyond any normal reason, and an overall lack of clarity in my mind, to the point where you question reality. I repeat tread very very lightly with drugs like this, if you have other options that are not drugs, by all means stay the heck away from this drug.

I had an accident that caused nerve damage to my neck and was in a lot of pain that otc meds or gabapenten wouldn’t help. 
My dr started me on nortriptoline and within 3 days I had pain relief. Mood was still the same. But after 3 weeks on nortriptoline my depression and pain was completely gone! I was sleeping like a baby, I woke up ready for the day, joined a gym, I was happy, pain free, had energy. It was truly a God send. 
My only side effects was weight gain and constipation. After 2 years on it I decided to quit taking it because despite exercise and eating healthy, I couldn’t lose a pound. I only had bowel movements once a week. 
I didn’t have any side effects coming off of the medication. I tapered myself. 

I’ve been off of nortriptoline for over a year now. My pain is manageable. I’ve lost the weight I gained. But the depression is kicking my butt despite trying all sorts of natural antidepressants (SAM-e, St. John’s wort, etc) 
So I’m actually thinking of going back on nortriptoline. I’ve never felt as good as I did on it. Its almost worth the weight gain to be happy, have energy and sleep normal.

My pain relief is not complete, I still have to be very mindful of movement because of breakthrough pain at 25mg. I missed a dose the other week and the pain that crept in towards the next dose time was quite high, so I know that it's providing quite a bit of relief. The side effects are much easier for me than Amitriptyline (very groggy/hungover even at low doses). Mornings are not my friend now, but they're manageable.

Had terrible headaches & nausea for 2 full wks. after that I thought things were on the upside. I realized even though I seemed more depressed than ever. My night terrors were gone!I have PTSD. So decided to keep taking it & it was so gradual I didn’t notice that my anxiety along with depression was getting worse. Then although no more night terrors & always had weird dreams but not bothersome. I started having dreams that were very intrusive & bothered me having them. Then noticed that when I took my Ativan. It was like it barely worked or was like taking a placebo. Didn’t help at all! Thought just give it time . It takes a while to get to feeling better. The 4th. Wk. & my appointment to see my Dr. I woke up throwing up & diareah & so exausted I couldn’t make my appointment. This lasted almost 3 days & had no desire to eat at all. I thought! A virus should only last 24 hrs. But stopped altogether on 3 Dr. day but stayed exausted. More like lethargic, was becoming irritated & agitated & developed a cough that was quite continuous even when I didn’t smoke! Realized I went 3 days without eating & only drinking a half cup of coffee & not even water. Nothing else in 3 days. Was dwelling on suicide all day & never did that. Crying all day & seen no hope left . That it would be best for my family if I just died. Didn’t realize or couldn’t think straight for anything to say hey! Your Genetic Luvox is causing more & more bad side effects. It’s not you . It has to be this medication. So after being off of it, not smoking for 3 days. But also not eating & drinking another 3 days. I caught myself laughing & feeling amazed because it had been so song that I laughed or even smiled. Well, started taking the Luvox again thinking maybe I didn’t give it enough of a chance. Nausea, headaches extremely high anxiety , hopelessness , thinking of suicide again, insomnia , horrible bothersome dreams were all immediately back! I decided it had to be the medication & it’s only created different bad side effects all along! I’ve only been off a few days again now. But still experiencing some bad side effects. I’m hoping within a wk. will be done with all of those! My anxiety is so bad even with 2 milligrams of Ativan twice a day. It’s like I’m stuck. If I get up moving around my anxiety increases instead of getting better. So depressed by not being able to do anything but sit still . I cry all the time & easy! If someone barely snaps at me! My anxiety goes into panic & can’t stop crying! I regret ever trying this medication. I read a review a man wrote that was quite similar to mine. He said after stopping it in less than a month. He said it took a full wk. to stop having all bad side effects! I’m hangin on & praying they will all be gone for me. Hopefully no withdrawals that I hear that are so horrible after stopping it because I hadn’t been on it long & at a low dose! I know what they are talking about though! I never had any problem stopping an antidepressant before. If I had taken the highest dose for so long & usually little to no improvement. I’d just stop & that would be that! But once had been put in Cymbalta & took it for about a yr. at the highest recommend dosage but why take any medication if it’s not working or barely working enough to tell. But the withdrawals I had was like I had quit the worst street drug in the world! I didn’t know what the hell was going on! I went a whole month! With  side effects of the devil let me tell you! Went to the Dr. Ran test & nothing wrong! But found a forum. Well, actually my husband said come here. Everyone that was on this forum was explaining the exact same miserable withdrawals from stopping Cymbalta cold turkey! It took months to get better.

On this dose, I had pretty significant dry mouth, and I was unable to fall asleep at night without taking another medication to help with sleep (this drug is a stimulant).  I also noticed a somewhat decreased appetite.  As far as effectiveness, this drug definitely helped with my headaches.  Within 2 weeks, I saw a decrease in the severity of the headaches and I had more days headache-free each month (before taking the drug I was having about 5 headache free days a month).

I had the opposite experience. It is my ""go-to"" for major depression. I do not like taking pharmaceuticals, and prefer holistic approaches that work around that, but Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant that brings me up to a functional level and out of the deep black hole depression that so negatively effects me and makes life feel not worth it. I have my husband, my cat, friends and family, and strong spiritual practices and beliefs that include meditation, deep breathing, and connecting to Source. When my chemistry pulls me down, it is so difficult to function, even with these good things and people in my life. These loved ones notice that I am better for taking Wellbutrin. I also get acupuncture regularly since 2007.

I believe we each have individual responses to ""what goes in,"" i.e., food, supplements, medications, etc. So if someone else decides to try this, I would say to work closely with a trusted doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, to monitor the effects, and find it useful, or find it doesn't work for you. 

I take 100mg once daily in the morning. I'm grateful to have Wellbutrin. I have taken it, and been weaned off of it with my doctor's support, on and off since 2000. So I wasn't sure how to answer the question since there have been years since 2000 where I didn't need it.Read More Read Less  "

I couldn’t do anything. I was so tired I could only do the bare minimum in life. I couldn’t keep up with cleaning, I could barely cook food, I couldn’t focus or concentrate on anything, I had a very short term memory, I couldn’t take care of my personal hygiene at all. My hair was matted or greasy all the time, I looked about 10 years older than I am, I had bad anxiety and would get panic attacks daily, my skin was always broken out because I just didn’t have it in me to take care of myself. I was extremely underweight and couldn’t put any on. Important things in my life weren’t being done, like bills getting paid on time. I was a complete mess and thought I was slowly dying, because of how badly it all affected my body. It affected my energy level so badly that I couldn’t get out of bed for weeks at a time. I barely had the strength to roll over at times. I was always irritated, and would flip out and rage at the drop of a hat, then experience extreme guilt. My relationship was falling apart because of this, I have no idea why he stayed. I had no desire for any sexual activity. The thought of it was repulsive to me. I didn’t want to be touched by anyone, not even hugs goodbye. I wish I had gone to a psychiatrist sooner. This medication has pulled me out of the dark hole I was in. I have energy again. I’m able to clean and organize my living space, I can cook every day, I shower on a regular basis now, I can concentrate, and I’m able to take care of all of the important things in my life again. My libido seems to have returned as as well. I feel love and desire for my partner again. This medication was an add on to the SSRI I was taking. My current dose is 100mg twice daily. The first 4 days were weird, but it wasn’t any worse than I was already feeling.  I called it “emotionally uncomfortable”. After about 2 weeks I noticed how much better I was feeling. I haven’t experienced many side effects. I was dizzy, and had a bit of dry mouth, for the first couple weeks. I do experience regular constipation, and dizziness every now and then, and I have some insomnia but it’s better than the insomnia I had prior. The minimum side effects are worth it!

I however became very drowsy, but I don’t think it was from the Wellbutrin because I’ve been very sleep deprived from the insomnia and that night I slept 10 hours, I didn’t really feel any other side effects. This morning I took 1 150 XL around 9am and my anxiety completely went away and I didn’t feel drowsy after taking the pill, but my head definitely feels slightly dizzy and loopy.

That I literally couldn’t think of any other way to calm down other than dying. I got out of the car and got in the passenger seat. I told my husband I didn’t think it was a good idea for me to drive anymore. I never took another pill. It took that moment for me to realize that I was losing it on the medication. I was only able to recognize it because my sister had the same reaction to another anxiety medication and I was making it a point to watch for my side effects. It scares me to my core what might of happened if I had continued the medication. Read More Read Less

Prozac, Celexa, Abilify and maybe one or 2 others that I can’t remember because they did nothing and I went off them within a few months.  I will say I did take name brand Wellbutrin back in 2007.  I don’t remember feeling much different mentally or physically, but I did at the time lose 20-30 lbs, however after a few months, the prescription all of a sudden was some crazy price.  I want to say over $200 a month so I stopped.  This time though, having only been on it for about 9 days, a week at 150 and now 300 for a few days, I felt something yesterday that I hadn’t felt in a very long time…. Happy!  I can’t explain it.  It feels weird because I haven’t felt this in so long.  I know it’s super early, but I’ve had 2 days in a row of feeling something I haven’t felt in so many years.  It almost feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of me.  I didn’t realize how depressed I had become until I felt what I felt a couple days ago.  I’m not going to say life changer yet, but I will definitely say that if this feeling continues.  I have energy again, music sounds better, I’m smiling and not just for appearances.  Had some bad insomnia last night and that kinda was a negative, but no other side effects.  Appetite is subdued and I have no urge to drink of smoke weed, which I had been doing almost nightly for a couple years (alcohol longer).  I didn’t want to review this early, but I want to share my initial experience.  I really hope it continues.  I’m taking generic 300xl, but seems to be working great.  I’m kinda sitting here in awe and thinking to myself, “man, I was even more depressed than I thought”.  This feels so much different.  I think when I took it in 2007 I wasn’t as depressed so I didn’t feel much other than the weight loss.  A lot of things have happened in my life since 2007 (both parents dying, divorce, etc) that had brought me to a very low place where I was barely surviving.  I really hope this feeling lasts because it’s not that I feel like me again, I feel like a new, better version of me.  Read More Read Less  "

Just tried to take the natural way out due to being afraid of side effects along with the opinions of other people. I am on day 4 of Wellbutrin and it might be to early to say, but I literally just want to cry tears of joy because this is so unreal. I actually feel grounded, like I am presently here. Not floating away in my thoughts somewhere or needing to be on my phone 24/8 to keep my mind from not wanting to deal with negative emotions. I definitely do still have some intrusive thoughts here and there, but they don’t hurt anymore and I am able to just brush it off within minutes. I don’t dwell on negative thoughts anymore. I haven’t really hit the energy part of it yet, but fair to say I’ve been more energized and motivated than usual. Waking up at 6am and in bed by 8-9pm.

I’ve been taking Zoloft for anxiety for a few years, but for awhile I had been feeling increasingly apathetic to things I knew I should care about more, constant low mood, very low energy, always tired regardless of how much sleep I got. It was awful. I really wanted to quit the Zoloft altogether, but my doctor wanted to add Wellbutrin. I’ve heard many negative experiences & was very hesitant to start it, especially since I’m prone to anxiety and I was scared that it would worsen it. I brought my worries up with my doctor & she assured me if I started low & slow, I’d have very tolerable (if any) bad side effects. She had me cut my 150mg XL (which apparently you’re not supposed to do but I was fine) and start for a week on a 1/4 of a pill &  and worked up to the whole dose of 150mg.

You need to know the manufacture of the generic.  It is a MYTH that the generics are bioequivalent to brand wellbutrin. Each generic pharma company uses different fillers and coating and mixtures of the drug.  You can read on line in several forums the varying differences of the different pharma companies generics of wellbutrin.  It's not the drug per se that is causing side effects but may very well be the generic brand that is causing the side effects or NOT WORKING  at ALL.  Read More Read Less

I also feel very focused and feel very similar effects that I felt when I was on Adderall, without the horrible comedown and jitters... I've also eliminated any cravings for nicotine.

3102,Wellbutrin SR Oral,4/28/2019,19-24,Female,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Depression,5.0,5,5,5,"Background:   I’ve experienced depression on and off since I was 14. In university, I was a physics major, which was challenging and engaging, but could also be soul-crushingly hard. Even getting slightly behind would leave me completely overwhelmed struggling to catch up. Multiple times I fell into a hole of deep depression, binging/bulimia.     Despite all this, I got hired to do my dream job the summer before senior year. When I got back to school however, I started slipping back into depression. Everything in my life was good, so I couldn’t understand why I was still depressed. At this point I had tried every non-medication treatment under the sun: therapy, meditation, journaling, etc. There are so many things they say you should do when you’re depressed (get out of the house, exercise, challenge negative thoughts, engage your mind in a task, etc.), but for me it was almost impossible to do these things when my brain was telling me I couldn’t even get out of bed. I decided to see a psychiatrist.     Experience on medication:   I I got lucky that Wellbutrin was the first thing my clinician prescribed me — bc I genuinely felt a difference within the first day. Tasks no longer seem insurmountable, and I can easily challenge my negative thoughts or lack of motivation.     I take 150mg and have actually been able to overcome lifelong insomnia with the help of a very consistent bedtime routine (dim lights, shower, make tea, do a couple Duolingo lessons, put meds on my bedside table, and watch an ASMR video). My alcohol tolerance is somewhat lower than before, but it’s not bothersome. The most interesting side effect is that while in most situations it keeps my emotions quite even-keeled, when I am watching a show, concert, movie, or other art form, I can become moved to tears by it — in a good way! Maybe this sounds silly, but I actually feel like I get to more fully experience what it means to be human now. Anyway, I can’t recommend Wellbutrin highly enough.Read More Read Less  "

Years later, I felt the side effects. The room was spinning when i laid down, dry mouth, excessive thirst, horror movie situations, visions of my under garments and inside my house during sleep, couldn't find my way out of an office, driving in circles continously, thinning of hair, darker and excessive hair on face, arms, legs, face and pubic area. Slow speech and movement. Throbbing of my brain. Changes in facial features, tired, angry, slurred speech, excessive weight in arms, legs and mid section. I couldn't sit still, shaking of my hands, plumpy and raised veins a wide eyed stare. Visions of eating something with my eyes closed and mouth chewing but nothing was there. Excessive sweating and cold shaking, trouble breathing, not hungry and seeing magical figures floating around the room. It was real because I touched one and it changed my face. I would walk around without a care in the world and spend money foolishly and money would disappear. The symptoms would be a recipe for more medication and more aftereffects.

It started with crying, anger, and then I started feeling rage. I believe most people that know me would say that I am a nice person, but not yesterday. My head felt like it was in a vice grip. I suffer from panic attacks, but I would rather go through them then make my family suffer with these mood swings. Read More Read Less  "

Long story short: On or about the 4th day it occurred to me that many of my symptoms seemed to have lessened markedly and i would also say that i never personally thought the drug was helping me. The exreme head and neck sweating/nightsweats,too, just stopped(i always thought it was a narcotic drug i was taking), the stomach pains went away, the body aches all but stopped, the nausea dissipated, and the dry mouth subsided. also, constipation resolved. I did pickup the refill but have not taken for two weeks and am going to ask doc for something different. Of all of these, the sweating and stomach pains were the worst. It has to have been this drug. So glad i accidentally got off for several days because i would have continued my miserable existance blaming all this on a narcotic. i feel so much better and can't believe one little pill can create so much misery. jeannette in floridaRead More Read Less  "

I've seen an ENT specialist, as GP couldn't find anything wrong. The ENT couldn't find anything wrong either. I am positive it has to be a side effect from the generic Welbutrin, as it didn't start happening until I started taking it.     As for overall satisfaction, I feel normal. I have been on anti-depressants off and on for 4 years, and I feel like I could successfully stop taking it now (and the side effects would stop).

I had horrible panic attacks daily and had gotten to a point I wasn’t able to eat anything outside of a specific list of “safe foods” and only going to certain places out of fear of divination causing more panic attacks.  I originally tried Zoloft, and then when that failed to help, Fluvoxitine. A little better. My psychiatrist had me try Luvox (generic) starting at 100mg then upping to 100mg twice a day. SUCH A MASSIVE difference. My OCD is practically non existent and no more panic attacks. I however have noticed since gaining weight during the pandemic/perhaps due to the stress the past 1.5 years that my OCD is a little more peaked. My DR is upping to 300mg to see if that alleviates.  (None of my tabs are extended release, also therapy has helped with coping skills)  I have an overall very positive review for this drug. I will note that the withdrawal for this if you miss a dose or doses is excruciating. I also notice  my sleep patterns are a little off at times.

Prior to it, I tried every SSRI and newer drugs like Cymbalta. Wellbutrin is the only drug for depression that I could live with. ALL the others cause sexual problems, weight gain, sleepiness, fatique and still don't get rid of all the depression. One doctor added Zyprexa to the SSRIs I was taking and I put on 40 pounds! Getting off SSRIs are tough too. Electric shocks felt in my head and lights. Would never ever go back to them. Wellbutrin actually caused a boost in libido, weight loss and high energy. If I had it to do over again, Wellbutrin XL would be the starting med, not the SSRI classes. Think about it this way: If you're depressed now, how much more will you be when you lose interest in sex, gain weight, fall asleep at work, home, doctor's waiting room and have no energy to do anything? Those are the downsides of the SSRI class of meds. For me, they made my life worse. I am rarely depressed now and take nothing else for it but an occasional Xanax if in a highly stressful situation at work. I lost all the weight I gained, hike 5+ miles on weekends, kayak and have a normal sex life. Please give Wellbutrin a try and if it doesn't work after a month or so, then try the others.

Since being back on this, I must say I am satisfied with it. I have been off Concerta for a year, and Bupropion has helped me to also keep my ADHD problems(impulsiveness, hyperactivity) in check. I know this whole review probably doesn't matter too much, but I wanted to give some insight for people with ADHD who are either starting or debating starting this medication. I see a lot of reviews from people who are taking this for depression, so it'd be good to see something from someone with ADHD.

I don't feel dizzy, I feel off balance and have to hold on to things to keep my balance. I also started having severe nausea that Zofran and Phenergan didn't even start to help me. My worst symptom has been an irregularity in my speech pattern. I hesitate and pause between my words. I know what I want to say it is just very difficult to get the words out. Nausea is a little better during the day but all my symptoms get worse in the evening and night. Has anyone else had difficulties with speech while on this medicine? The speech difficulties have been going on for almost 4 weeks. The other symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past month and a half. I am seeing a Neurologist and he doesn't know why I am having such terrible speech difficulties. I would really like to know if anyone else has had these symptoms?Read More Read Less  "

My doc gave me a 30 day supply of 522 mg Aplenzin to try and it was as if someone turned the lights on.  After only ONE day I noticed an immediate feeling of well-being that was bordering on euphoria without having to worry about the crash & burn.  Although I am unable to take a daytime nap, I have no trouble sleeping at night.   I am worried about the price - when I started it cost $1500/month and now it is almost $3000/month... this seems very high, but then again, nothing has ever worked as well as Aplenzin.   I am afraid that my insurance company will decide that it is not worth the cost to have one of their patients feeling so good.  While my sex drive is hampered a bit (but I also have low-T) and I may have put on a few extra pounds, I hardly consider those side effects troublesome enough to stop the Aplenzin.

I took it every day while I was still smoking! Yes you keep smoking. What it was doing to me then was reducing the amount of cigarettes that I was smoking each day.

First it was recommended for me to go on the pill for my health which made me feel suicidal and depressed, it was terrible! So I stopped taking those. Then I was prescribed with this antidepressant and wow, does it work!! The only down side is, you get diarrhea for the first two weeks, and if you on it for too long, it will zap all the energy out so you must take breaks when your body starts to feel fatigue, it's a cue to ween off it. Also, if you are on it too long you will get headrushes which is also a cue to come off them. But wow, overall my experience was great! You get vivid dreams too, nice dreams. It makes you calm, relaxed, no negative thoughts. Just don't go on these if you take other medication that might conflict, check first! Otherwise, it's a 9/10 (I rated 9 because of side effects, which are minor tbh)Read More Read Less  "

Told me it would take a while for it to take effect. when I stopped taking Xanax after 4 or 5 days, I guess this had taken effect because I started feeling great, and still do after about a month and a half.

3232,Citalopram Oral,9/19/2023,19-24,Female,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Depression,1.0,1,1,1,"Biomedical Science graduate experience (medical observations I made whilst on citalopram):
I started taking citalopram at nearly 20 years old. I had on and off depression since aged 12 due to bullying and parental addiction, but my ex cheating on me in second year of university was the “tip of the iceberg”. I finally caved in and decide to give antidepressants a try, and was put on 20mg Citalopram. Looking back, this somehow dragged the heartache on for nearly 2 years, and I wasn’t able to move on with my life until I stopped taking them. I started in February 2022, and didn’t sit my second year university exams in May 2022, pushing them forward to August ‘22 and scoring in the 40’s and 50’s when I usually score higher. I lost all motivation for university. Come final year, I never went to lectures, I was so unbearably fatigued, I was only alert for about 7 hours a day before fighting sleep. In about December 2022 I experienced OCD behaviours, including “intrusive thoughts” for the first time, which deeply disturbed me and made me feel like I was losing my mind. I failed my final year exams, I struggled severely with my dissertation progress throughout the year, and my sexual libido was completely gone. In August ‘23, after watching all my peers graduate, and noting the severe fatigue, weight gain (from a much slower metabolism since starting- gained over 2 stone in one year), OCD behaviours and emotional numbness, I decided to stop, to focus on my repeat exams. This time, unlike other previous attempts at withdrawing, I finally pushed through the severe withdrawal symptoms; active suicidal thoughts, paranoia, severe anxiety and depression. I “cold-turkey” quit them (sudden and not graduate withdrawal) and found I still lacked the motivation for exams I once had before taking these, as well as have the energy I once had. After a couple of months however I got my “personality” back. I was no longer numb to emotions, which can actually mirror depression and unconsciously keep you in a depressive state for much longer than  usual. My “baseline” depression prior to taking anti depressants never included active suicidal thoughts. I noticed withdrawals from antidepressants cause a dip that is much worse than the “original baseline” of depression (prior to medication). It was frightening. 
The one thing antidepressants did help me with was hyperhydrosis (cold sweats) from anxiety. It also prevented me from over-reacting with anger to situations. It was like there was an “angel on my shoulder” defending the person I was mad at and helped me see reason and realise when I was in the wrong or over-reacting to a situation. 
Fast forward a few months post-quitting citalopram, my metabolism is working properly again, I’m losing weight naturally, hyperhydrosis is completely gone (which I struggled with for about 4 years prior to medication). Sexual libido never returned to normal but isn’t necessarily gone. My anger has returned. But despite this, I also experience happiness in a way antidepressants didn’t allow. Life if full of ups and downs, but antidepressants just gave me bleak nothingness. No real emotion; which includes severe happiness. I finally laughed and danced again, sang to songs in the car, my “ups” are so worth the slight anger I may have noticed, and the depression has most certainly subsided. Like I said, that “nothingness” can be mistaken by the brain as “I feel low/ depressed today.” I also passed my exams (barely) and am graduating this December. I will never look back at antidepressants, and would never advise them to anybody. Read More Read Less  "

I suffer from Depression, anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I have been on sertraline before but i wanted to try something different so was prescribed Citalopram. first 2-3 weeks were the worst as your body needs to get used to the drug in your system. After 4 weeks i do feel better and after 8 weeks i feel much better. I feel like my old self again. There are days where i feel down and the odd intrusive thought but this drug really has helped me live a normal life.
NO drug will ever get rid of your problems completely, but they will help reduce your symptoms and not consume your mind.

Remember you are not alone, good luck with your journey and remember..

Give Citalopram at least 8 weeks and if you do not feel better, speak to your GP.

I started taking citalopram 15 y ago. It's by far the best of these 3 with a better profile if you miss a dose. 

Note: Scientology hate mental health drugs. You should be a spectical of 1 star reviews as this is a know activity of Scientologists. And from I read here, pretty poor writers making insane claims that are deliberately negative and pretty clearly over the top.

I intend to gradually ease off of it, despite it being really, really helpful. 
I had major stress with life trauma, hence l could not sleep more than two hours a night, lost weight and couldn’t go out of the house - it was horrific.
My doctor, helped me even though it was only by phone calls, and suggested an anti depressant.
I did feel, as he had warned me ,
that l may feel unpleasant for the first few days.
Yes, l did, but after a few days l started to feel normal as l was able to sleep!
I gained my confidence back, sleep like a log, 7 or 8 hours a night ( Sleep Station ) my doctor put me in touch with them online - and am generally okay. 
So I would say thanks
 to my doctor and to the treatment that worked!  I do try to stay strong and as a senior keep moving and busy.

3242,Citalopram Oral,9/19/2022,25-34,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Panic Disorder,4.7,5,5,4,"Every year or so I have chronic spells of panic disorder. These usually last for 4/5 months but are at there peak from a month to 3 months. My main symptom is dizziness which makes me afraid to do even the most simple of tasks, in fear of passing out. Even a simple 1 to 1 conversation can have me fighting to stay conscious. Anyway, citalopram. Currently on my second spell with this medication and here's my experience. On 10mg, Days 1 and 2, really sick, could hardly eat. Days 3 and 4, borderline unbearable. Felt so dizzy it was a struggle to even go to the toilet. From around a week the side effects slowly started to pass but the anxiety was alot higher than it was before medication. After around 2 weeks the heightened anxiety passed and I was feeling similar to how I was pre medication. Between weeks 2 and 3, I started to notice I felt more calm, my eating had picked up and my mind was racing. I was no longer pre meditating the worst outcome in every situation, though I was still getting the odd moment of unnecessary anxiety. Dr decided to move me up to 20mg. I was fearful at first, because the side effects were so severe on 10mg and I had to take time off work. I've been on 20mg for a week now and I feel like I'm getting closer to being my old self again, and as an added bonus, absolutely no side effects at all from the upping of dosage. All these feelings are very similar to the 1st time I took citalopram. They make you feel disgusting to begin with, even I wanted to stop after a few days despite knowing from before that this was normal and that it would help me in the long run. Give it a chance. This pill helps me when I'm at my lowest and I plan on staying on it alot longer this time. Book a few weeks off work, don't make any plans at all and ride out the storm. It will get better, I promise. Good luck to everyone fighting mental illness, it really is hard and I hope you find peace soon.Read More Read Less  "

I was on it from 2017 - 2021 and felt so good that I thought I could wean myself off. After a few months off the medication, I once again felt hopeless, tired, and lost all motivation to enjoy life.

Christmas 2022 I started feeling very depressed and couldn’t stop crying. I have had anxiety too but I’ve had that for over 10 years. This was different I just reached rock bottom. I was already on a different anxiety medication but I felt like it was no longer working, I had to have time off from my job due to the depression. They upped my dose at this time but it made me a lot worse. Fast forward they started on me on fluoxetine. I won’t lie the start was rough for me but I don’t know if that was just also associated with how I was feeling but I had nausea, diarrhoea amongst other things. I eventually with my doctors help upped my dose till I got to the dose we thought would be appropriate for me which is 40mg. The anxiety and depression was bad for a while until they kicked in probably about 8 weeks fully but when they did kick in I felt better little by little. I decided that the job I was in was not helping towards how I had been feeling and so I got a new job which I started in June of last year. Fast forward 9 months and I am happy within my job, I have a boyfriend and I am very much happy and content. The depression is gone but I still struggle from time to time with anxiety but it’s nowhere near as bad as it was and I am still on the medication as I choose to be. The only thing I would say is obviously like any antidepressant they numb your emotions so I do find that if I’m upset and feel like I want to cry, I can’t. But overall I am happy. I hope this helps someone else. You are not alone and make sure you also have a good support network around you. Read More Read Less  "

It was great! I thought this is the medicine I had prayed for. I started having leg cramps and was concerned my potassium could be low. I went to my primary physician and had blood test. She checked for potassium, magnesium, liver functions and my sugar levels. All of them were crazy! My Doctor was so upset! A year ago by bloodwork was perfect. She said she was extremely concerned about my liver function and insisted I get off this medication as soon as possible before any more damage was done.  I was so scared of what the medicine had done, yet so afraid of the pain returning, I felt very lost. I am about to start going through the process of being weaned off of this medication.

The physical side effects were- migraines, severe muscle aches, teeth grinding in sleep, strong fatigue and the main one that made me come off was my spinal pain it was very intense. The Doctor also suggested that I come off right away as I gave it 2 weeks in the hope it’ll adapt with time but the side effects were only becoming worse. The moment I stopped taking them I’d feel a lot better so these weren’t for me. Everyone reacts differently to meds but this is my experience on them, I’ll be switching to other ones- it may be trial & error till I find ones that suit me. Read More Read Less  "
3271,Fluoxetine Oral,12/18/2022,25-34,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Anxiousness associated with Depression,4.0,4,4,4,"So I thought id do updates as time goes on starting on 20mg as I know it’s help others, I am now a week in! The first 5 days I’d say were the peak of my side effects which included, feeling drowsy, weak and slightly nauseous also more anxious then usual.. the only side effects I now have is some headaches, jaw tightness, it’s also increased my appetite which I’d say I need to be careful with as I’m not looking to gain any further weight and muscle aches. It hasn’t much affected my sleep, my concentration is seeming to improve a little however my overall moods aren’t yet improving as in I feel pretty much the same prior to starting. I’m glad the side effects are gradually easing off as I adapt to the meds after the first week. I’m just eagerly awaiting and hoping to feel the positive results- I’ll be giving it time over the next few weeks and update another review. Most my anxiety symptoms have been, over worrying, overthinking, easily frustrated, negative thoughts, future worries, feeling anxious constantly and struggling to cope with work & overall life stresses, this also affected my memory massively- I just knew this wasn’t how I wanted to continue with this dark cloud taking over . I also want to say for those who are worried about starting any antidepressants, don’t let the overthinking get in the way as this is something I was doing for such a long time, the right meds will hopefully give you that extra support you need as something I’ve personally realized is leaving any mental health conditions untreated is only going to make it worse. 

I hope this helps many others :)

I was depressed, anxious and easily frustrated at some points of the month which seemed to center around my menstrual period.  I would cry for no reason, get upset or mad for no reason, I was super sensative, got frustrated VERY easily and was extremely anxious at times.  It interfered with all of my relationships - my family (especially my parents), my boyfriend, my friends (especially my rooommate and best friend).  I was reluctant to start taking this medication, as I was afraid to feel like a different person or TOO happy or disconnected with reality.  After reading reviews, I decided to start it... it was worth a shot.  I'm going on my 8th month and I feel like myself with a happy outlook on life, a more balanced mood and more control over my emotions.  My frustration level has gone WAY down, which was one of my biggest problems.  My relationships have become better and easier... and everyone notices a huge difference in my mood and personality.

He did not tell me two things...one, it contains an anti-psychotic and two, it would cause me to gain a ton of weight.  I've been weening myself off of it, faster than I probably should, but it does little for the fibro pain and helps with the sleep problem very little.  He was miffed when I said I was going off of it...too bad.  I was on two pills a day..once in the morning and then 12 hours later.  In the last 3 weeks I've taken only 4 which is great because my super blurry vision has greatly subsided, plus I'm starting to drop some weight and I actually feel better than I did when I was taking this poison.  I also discovered there are a lot of medications that you cannot take while being on this because of severe and possibly fatal effects of the drug interactions.  I think doctors owe it to their patients to tell them EVERYTHING about a drug BEFORE throwing a prescription at them...had I known this stuff beforehand, I NEVER would have taken it.Read More Read Less  "

3344,Perphenazine-amitriptyline Oral,9/28/2010,55-64,,6 months to less than 1 year,,Other,1.0,1,1,1,"I was prescribed this medication under the brand name Trilafon as a teenager in 1970 by a psychiatrist who had never met me, on the basis of one meeting he had with my parents, who were concerned that I was smoking pot and having sex.  The dosage far exceeded what is currently typical for someone suffering from psychosis, which I was not. After about 3 weeks, my vision became so blurred I could not read, and my breasts began producing milk even though I had never been pregnant and was barely sexually active.  Essentially, I was given a temporary chemical lobotomy--I had no emotional affect whatsoever, and my cognitive capacity was significantly reduced. I finally met the prescribing doctor about a week AFTER he had my parents admit me to the psychiatric ward of a hospital. The psychiatrist who did this was on staff at a State Hospital in NYS as a director of pharmacological research and as a clinical psychiatrist at a private Catholic Hospital in Utica NY.  I believe he abused his authority, which resulted in great harm to me and many of his other patients.  He was a Cuban born doctor who had worked for a Cuban government agency and came to the U.S. near the end of WW II, according to a biography I found last year in a psychiatric journal from the 1950s. This was a classic case of bad science and bad medicine.  For me, this medication was poison, and I am lucky I survived this trauma. Read More Read Less  "

I’ve been struggling with severe anxiety/OCD and some depression for the last 5-6 years. It affected me so much and most people close to me don’t understand. I tried in total about a dozen medications before landing on my current combination of Paxil 50mg, Wellbutrin 300mg, and Anafranil 150mg. I now can say that I’m almost completely symptom free with very little anxiety left. I don’t know why my condition was so hard to treat, but I know this happens to a lot of people. You have to just keep trying and never give up. Also, the Wellbutrin is a great adjunct medication that can offset certain side effects of Paxil and also augment it. Hopefully this helps and maybe the same combination of drugs can work for you too. Read More Read Less  "

I probably didnâ??t Wean off as slow as some, but I followed doctors orders. At its worst, I cried hysterically, contemplated suicide, had rage over the slightest thing, nauseous, brain zaps, and constant ringing in my ears. I was dizzy and had vertigo. It was not safe for me to drive. Iâ??m still having the brain zaps but not as bad. The wellbutrin has completely changed my mood.

With Paxil the hot flashes became much less frequent and less intense and I was very happy. The first 2 months were great but then horrible headaches began off and on every day and even Advil could not stop the pain.  Then lightheadedness and extreme nausea with no relief.  Called my doctor 24hrs ago and no response.  Probably not supposed to stop cold but I will not continue taking Paxil.  Only slight headaches now and the nausea not as bad but still there.

Not only that, but it decreased sexual performance--which isn't something I really care about, but it happened. As an SSRI, it's supposed to be non-addictive and have no/minimal withdrawal symptoms. Let me tell you that after I quit taking it, I had the worst withdrawal symptoms of my life. I was dizzy, nauseous, and every time I moved my eyes, my whole body tingled and felt like I was being shocked. It was terrifying so and so hard to explain. It made me never want to try drugs again.

I do get the odd 'electrical' zap in the neck, I am more emotional than I was, and I have what I consider to have anger issues. The anger issues weren't something I thought might be  related to going off the Paxil. I believe I had anger issues beforehand so I never gave it any thought.

At I be point I was diagnosed with ptsd and went through emergency therapy which helped. I no longer experience ptsd. I have mostly anxiety, seasonal depression and paranoid personality. I haven’t used any medications in about the last 5-6 years. Prior to that I would be on something for anxiety/depression for a couple of years or less and wean off because I was just not feeling myself or happy with the medications. I didn’t believe medications were necessary and that you could control your moods and anxieties with sheer willpower, a healthy diet and a positive mindset. That worked for a while until it didn’t anymore. Life dealt me some very unfortunate situations and I slowly lost myself. I was constantly worried, extremely paranoid (probably more than I have ever been my entire life), irritable, short tempered, and most of all sad. I didn’t care about my job and I didn’t find joy in much of anything. However, I tried to stay optimistic ..that it would pass. I knew I was getting in way over my head, so when I went to my annual appointment at my dr.’s and couldn’t answer a simple questionnaire without breaking down in tears, I knew it was time to try something else, even for just a little while. Honestly I was desperate and I was happy for her to simply suggest it. We decided on Zoloft at 25 mg. I was nervous. At first I felt extremely tired and then wired, and also nauseous. But it passed within just a few days. I felt immediate relief from everything.  Within the first week it seemed, a massive weight was lifted from me. I just can’t believe how great I feel still. I can find joy in my job again. I’m eager to set and achieve goals. I’m more patient with my child. I just have a newfound happiness and found the balance I have been needing for so long. I don’t think the medication has to be a life sentence but I need it to get through this time in my life and I’m so happy for it.
Side note… I had gained some weight (like 5-10 pounds) prior to starting the meds. I was worried  this medication would make me gain more. I’m very hungry on it so that’s the only thing I’m currently worried about. I wasn’t this hungry before and I don’t want to gain any more weight.

As long as i can remember ive been horrendous at dealing with stress and not getting my own way. Shouting and ranting. Ive never been physically violent to anyone but used to smash things up in a blind rage. When i was younger i remember doors being destroyed hitting walls etc. As i grew older i became more argumentative and very disagreeable, even when i 100% knew i was wrong, i just couldnt let go. As you can imagine it is very hard for my family (3 step children and 2 biological children with the same mother as the step children) to live with. I would argue with my fiancè 3 or more times a day and swear i was in the right all the time. She gave me chance after chance. I swore id never be too weak id need to medicate - probably my biggest mistake ever.

Ive been taking Sertraline for 2years now and wish i had done so from my early teens. My life is so much easier. The intense feelings of anger/rage arnt there anymore. I do take the highest recommended amount 200mg (I started on 50mg went to 100mg after 4months then 200mg after a huge row). It feels like a fog has been removed from all conversations i have and im able to understand whats being said rather than misinterpreting everything and feeling like its an attack on me or an insult. My relationship with my family is so much better now they dont feel like they have to walk on egg shells around me.

Taking this medication has changed my life and i will be forever grateful to my fiancée for putting up with my bs for aslong as she did.

Sertraline is a wonder drug!

I've been fighting depression for years with exercise and therapy off an on never tried an SSRI, but experienced 3 deaths in 6 months most recently of my mom.  I lost all control, starting hurting myself, was in a deep dark pit like never before, continuous thoughts of suicide.  Woke up the morning after my first dose with a bad case of diarrhea but that was the only downside.  The sadness was still there, however it was signifcantly lessened and much easier to put aside and focus on the day.  The impulses for self harm, nearly gone, not exactly happy but not suicidal which I'll take.  Listening to that urge to get on my exercise bike which is now louder than the one that tends to call DoorDash.  If not for the time spent in the bathroom, this would have been a perfect first day on Zoloft.

Lost a tonne of weight and I went on citalopram which didn't seem to do much so weaned myself off it about 8 months in. Had a period of relative recovery before anxiety over my lack of relationship went into overdrive a few months ago. I went on sertraline 50mg about two and a half months ago in an attempt to make me think more clearly. It kicked in at about 5-6 weeks and I was feeling much calmer for about a week. Started a new relationship and the anxiety came back again in full force so I upped the dosage to 100mg almost 3 weeks ago. The last few days my anxiety is almost back to square one. Overthinking, dry heaving in the mornings. I'm really keen not to lose this new relationship so I'm powering through and hoping that these symptoms will pass. I have resolved to come back and post a new review in about a month, hopefully with good news. If you are suffering out there and reading this review you are not alone. Read More Read Less  "

3391,Venlafaxine Oral,3/27/2024,35-44,,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Depression,1.0,1,1,1,"Two words to summarise Venlor : Life destructive.
I was prescribed Venlor by my GP after a consultation that lasted about 20 minutes. I consulted my GP because I was having difficulty sleeping and I was moody. He diagnosed it as possible depression and prescribed Venlor 37.5mg. It took about a week and half and I experienced a feeling of awareness. Hearing birds more distinctly was the first change I recognised. Then came the dreams - which were violent and mostly about me overcoming or surviving attacks by taking the life of my attacker. I woke up in extreme sweats. Needless to say the dreams were disturbing but I convinced myself that perhaps it symbolised “taking control” of my fears. 
The dreams and sweats continued to such an extent that I sought the vivid dream world. I couldn’t wake up in the mornings and all I wanted was to sleep - it turned my sleeping pattern upside down and I found myself awake at night , sad and unable to sleep- not wanting to sleep. When I finally did fall asleep I didn’t want to stop. Eventually I found myself in a destructive pattern , disconnected with my family - sleeping untill the last second that I had before I had to fetch my children from school. 
I also developed chronic painful gastric issues. 
All the while not realising why I felt the way I did. Not wanting to be part of anything or anyone. 
I went back to see my GP who told me that I had developed a resistance to the dosage and that it was normal. I told him about my tiredness and he gave me vitamin B shot. 
I was prescribed 75mg. It became worse and worse.
Two weeks ago I decided to start weening off. I couldn’t ignore what impact this horrible drug had on my life.
I started the process as recommended by medical advice.
It is excruciating. It is unbearable.

All that stops me from relieving the dreadful symptoms by taking another Venlor pill to make the pain of withdrawal stop is knowing that I have a goal. 
I am going to properly, publicly, factually and legally exploit , inform and warn the people of this poisonous concoction prescribed by negligent uniformed quacks that prescribe medication to people based on information given by those unqualified to do so - medical reps” .

Pounding headaches that wakes me up at night.  Loss of appetite.  Dry mouth.  Itchy, spider-feeling on my legs.  Zombie-like feeling. (only taking 75mg SR)  Loss of any emotions, could just stare into space all day long.  Extreme yawning and tiredness.  How can anyone live like this.

3394,Venlafaxine Oral,1/11/2024,19-24,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Repeated Episodes of Anxiety,1.0,1,1,1,"I started taking venlafaxine XR two days ago and I’ve never been in so much pain in my life. The first day started okay, I was a little nauseous, but it was okay. Then it really kicked in and it felt like I was completely disconnected from reality. I couldn’t feel any emotion, I became very numb, my brain started to feel weird and tingly, I couldn’t concentrate, had no desire to do anything productive like school work, I had no desire in my hobbies, I felt like a zombie. I didn’t really sleep at all because my brain felt so empty and if I did sleep, it was dreamless and 15 minutes max. I went into a manic episode through the night and it was not fun. The following day is today and school was a nightmare. I experienced very big pupils, severe pain on the right side of my skull and right eye, pressure in both of my eyes, a clenched jaw, heart palpitations and chest pain, I was yawning every couple of minutes but I didn’t feel tired, I couldn’t focus on my school work and didn’t even care. It got rid of my irrational anxiety, but also my rational anxiety that helps me get things done. It got rid of all emotions and interests, made me feel euphoric like I was on another plane of existence and that nothing mattered, I was very aware of myself and not aware of my surroundings, I’m severely dizzy and lightheaded and my vision keeps getting blurry. I keep seeing white and black spots in my vision, as well.
I would never recommend this and I was on a very low dose (37.5mg) and only two days on it and I feel worse than I ever did trying to manage my anxiety and depression without the meds. 
If you have a family history of eye problems, cholesterol and blood pressure issues, issues with bipolar disorder or manic disorders, or if you already experience migraines, lightheadedness and things to do with the heart (murmur, palpitations, skipping heartbeat, etc) I would definitely not suggest taking this drug. 
The withdrawal immediately if you don’t take it at the same time as the last pill is terrifying as well. I was half an hour past my window because I forgot to take my pill (since they were new) and my hands began to shake severely, I could barely move I was so sick to my stomach, I was lightheaded and had vertigo, just not a fun experience. 
If it does help, just know that going off of them or not being consistent is going to feel horrible because you’re body instantly becomes reliant on the drug and the withdrawal symptoms are ten times worse than the symptoms of simply taking it. 
I would recommend literally any other drug for depression or anxiety, but hats off to you if it helped you.Read More Read Less  "
3395,Venlafaxine Oral,1/9/2024,35-44,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Anxiousness associated with Depression,1.0,1,1,1,"I was put  onto Venlafaxine back in September 2023. This was after coming off of sertraline, that I have been on for many years. I was told that it would take awhile to get into my system, which it did, and I immediately noticed that my sleep was being disturbed. Secondly, that I was badly constipated. But I thought Stick with it.
I had frequent checkups with my mental health nurse, each time telling her that I was seeing no noticeable difference in my mood. In fact, I would go as far as to say, that my moods were worse, because of the forementioned side effects. Each time I mentioned that I wasn’t noticing any positive changes, my mental health nurse simply increased the dosage. I started, as most people do, on 75 mg per day. It was quickly increased to 150 mg per day, then 225 then 300 mg. 
I had an adult autism assessment, on the 1st of December 2023, which led to a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. 
This diagnosis led me to reevaluate my relationship with antidepressants. I made the decision to reduce the Venlafaxine.
First I reduced it to 225 mg for two weeks, then down to 150 mg then to 75 mg. My ultimate goal was removing it from my system. 
Reducing it to 75 mg per day has proved difficult. I was experiencing  terrible insomnia, nightmares. However, I am now on day number four of 0 mg per day and I feel like my body has gone into shock. I have not slept properly in four days. Every time I try to go to sleep, my body jolts me awake. When I do manage to go to sleep, I have the most horrible and vivid nightmares I’ve ever had in my life. 
The brain zaps were to be expected, but they are much worse than coming off of sertraline. My entire body is tingling. My hands will not function correctly. I am currently using dictation to write all of this down. I am sweating yet freezing cold. My heart rate was incredibly high, 106 bpm to be exact. I am lucky that my husband is here to look after me otherwise I fear I wouldn’t make it. I am truly hoping that the symptoms of withdrawal do not last me much longer, because I can tell you in my 39 years on this planet. No medication has ever done so little good for me, tortured me when I try to rid it from my system. 
I do not understand how these so-called medical professionals give you such little information about the implications that these harsh drugs can have on your body. I do not understand how they can increase such a strong drug in such a short space of time, all of this was done over a telephone. They have never met me in person. 
My advice to anyone who has had long-term mental health issues, do not take this medication. My advice is also to seek more specific help. I am 39 years old and only just learnt that I am autistic. This has allowed me the chance to be kinder to myself. I don’t think that pumping people full of medication is always the answer. 
Venlafaxine is a horrible drug, it had little to no positive effect on me, yet it has terrible withdrawals. 
I hope that some of what I have said, will help somebody somewhere not to put this garbage in their system.

3396,Venlafaxine Oral,11/7/2023,25-34,Female,10 years or more,Patient,Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome,3.3,4,4,2,"I used Venlafaxine for the past 15 yeas for major general anxiety.
I was always on low dosages. 
The highest I was on was 75 mg. I never felt happier,  however, my appetite increased a lot, but that wasn't the main problem.
The problem was thatI didn't care if I was getting fat, I didn't care for anything. 

I became so fearless that it started to put my life on danger. 

I tried to quit it (never cold turkey) like 5 times during these 15 years but without success. 

The anxiety was always back, couldn't sleep for 6 months, everytime was unbearable. 

So I managed to lower the dosage to 37.5 mg, which I took for the past 5 years . My anxiety is still there, but I can function - ish. 

Now for the first time, I succeeded to decrease to 1/3 of 37.5 mg without many side effects, beside the lack of serotonin în my body. 0 motivation, biterness, nothing really makes me happy. 

The conclusion is, these pills help, but my advise is to try something else. 
If nothing works, then go for it, but bear in mind that discontinuation syndrome can be very difficult and long ( depending on the duration of the treatment ).
Also, the best option to get rid of venlafaxine is to change it to a less addictive treatment if you want to quit it in a safer manner.

Shortness of breath, SEVERE NAUSEA, insomnia, chest pains, and constant overload of adrenaline so bad it hurt. Had to have another dose 2 weeks in to reduce withdrawl symptoms.

3401,Venlafaxine Oral,8/31/2023,25-34,Male,10 years or more,Patient,Panic Disorder,4.3,5,4,4,"I have been on a higher dose of Effexor XR than what I am reading others are on. I have been on the same dose now for 10 years, with previously extreme panic disorder and social anxiety. I was in such bad shape I couldn't even go to school, sleep, or do much of anything for a good 1-2 years. My original trial with the drug was not successful, as the symptoms managed to linger and depression came from not feeling any relief. I was then tested with other drugs and eventually introduced again to Effexor XR but with a new dosage when new studies came out. It took about a month and a half for myself to notice improvement, but studies have shown this drug works completely differently depending on the exact dosage given. I am comfortably on 150mg+37.5mg, so 2 pills, and have been symptom free and depression free for about 10 years. 

This drug literally saved my life, but it is not perfect. The side effects of ""forgetting"" to take your daily dose can be very bad, but this is a far cry from the symptoms I had to once deal with. The difference in what the drug does from 150mg only to adding 37.5 mg more but staying under 225mg is amazing. I have been on higher than 225mg before and as low as one 37.5 pill. Im sure depending on what the exact ailment is, these different doses can help. For me personally, the key was sucking it up for the month and waiting for the drug to actually kick in. It is also a very good idea to monitor both your sodium levels and liver, as you can get very dehydrated in the summer months. 

The side effects for this drug are minimal in relation to almost all drugs in its category. Ive been on some very terrible ones. I would not take much stock in the negative reviews of people who weren't on this drug for at least a full month and a half and at a dosage of at least 75mg. This drug takes time to even kick in, at any dose. I can only speak on the efficacy for panic/social disorder w/ comorbid depression

I was prescribed this for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). I could not tolerate 150 mg as it made me feel crazy and depressed. I stayed on 75 mg for many years. Before this medication, I had severe vertigo, bright colors were very overwhelming, I could not think very clearly and I felt extreme emotions. This medication has cleared that up, even on the small dose of 18.75 mg that I have been on for the past year. I wanted off of this medication and have been trying to wean off of it for two years. I have been cutting my 37.5 mg pills in half and taking it in the morning. This has worked well for me. I decided to try weaning lower and cutting the half in half to make approximately 9.375 mg and that is when the EXTREME issues began. After two days at this dose, I woke up in the middle of the night with the most extreme stomach pain that I have ever felt in my entire life. I cried in pain for an hour before violently throwing up and then another hour of extreme pain before it subsided enough that I could go back to sleep. I was left with nausea for the next two weeks and one more night of waking up with stomach pain (the second time was less severe). On a different night I experienced severe chills and then once that subsided terrible sweats (I did not have a fever). I was irritable, irrational and had sobbing sessions throughout this entire time. One of the days I felt extreme rage because my food was cold and then proceeded to spend the entire afternoon sobbing off and on. I hated everybody and that is not who I normally am. My boyfriend and I both were so confused and didn't understand what was happening to me. We finally realized that it was likely the reduction in Effexor and after two weeks I went back on 18.75 mg. It took about two days and I was back to my normal happy and calm disposition. I have a hard time rating this medication because while it did not help with GAD, it did help with other issues. Had I been aware that if I missed a dose by a couple of hours, I would experience brain zaps, fogginess, nausea and just a general feeling of being off kilter, or that trying to get off of it would be pure torture then I probably would have never taken it and would have tried other things first. It is heartbreaking because I want to eventually get pregnant and feel that this little pill is going to be a huge barrier for that. And God forbid there was ever an issue and I could not get to my medication. That thought terrifies me.

Past history-  I detoxed off benzos in 2010 also quit drinking. 
Diagnosed in April 2018 with vm. 
I thought the reviews about withdrawals were exaggerated mainly because a benzo detox is horrendous. I was wrong. I wish I trusted the reviews. 


It made me severly depressed apathetic. Lost my job due to covid layoffs. I went through my savings because I had no feelings. Coming off it was hell.  Electric shocks, severe anxiety. My memory is still horrendous. 
 I get over whelmed easily. I have been sober 13.5 years and I can honestly say taking venlafaxine was the worse decision I ever made.
 I wish the Nuerologist recommended magnesium glycinate and other vitamins before trying this. She immediately prescribed venlafaxine claiming it is the only med proven to pull me out of chronic vm.
 I still had migraines on the med. I just wasn't walking on a boat anymore. 
This prescription should only be used for people with severe depression and agoraphobia. 
It changed my brain chemistry. I no longer laugh and I lost my creative side. I no longer can day dream. 
I was a functioning migrainer before I took this med. I may not have been functioning like someone without migraines but I was definitely functioning more than I was on it and off it. 
I also gained 75 pounds had edema in my legs. It was fast the moment I was upped to 150mg is when I gained alot of weight. It also caused restless legs. Fatigue. And sweat would pour out of my scalp. Weird thing is my temp ran very low previous to taking venlafaxine. 

For migrainers I would try something else. It isn't worth it. Read More Read Less  "

Felt like the first drug to work after trying what feels like everything. I did have to bump up the dose a few times because my depression would come back but my OCD was almost entirely resolved which gave my life back. For that this drug has been amazing. 
One thing to note is you CANNOT miss a dose with this. It will mess you up for a few days mood wise, brains zaps, and feel all around crazy. I heard weening off is awful too. But if used consistently it works!Read More Read Less  "

The doctor started me at a dose of 20 mg. in the hospital, but that was way too much.  I became irritable, moody, manic, hyperactive in my thinking.  I also had crying spells.  He cut back the dose to 10 mg. and that was better, but the main cause of my depression lay in the fact that I was in a hospital where I had lost  control over my life.

It is not an instant relief, it takes about 4 weeks to build up in your system.  Once I started to adjust to this medicine, it allowed my brain a chance to process what was going before my emotional response took over.  It just gives me a chance to ""mentally breath"" before I react to what is happening.  This medicine has had a very positive impact on my well being and it has greatly helped with my ability to communicate better with the people around me.  My spouse says she is glad she got her husband back.  If you and your doctor decide that this medicine is something that you could try, give it enough time to work.

I feel a bit of calm and pride in finally taking medication but I think that's mostly a placebo effect so early on.

I just wanted to share the good advice my doctor shared with me since it seems some people do not have great relationships with their doctor.

It takes approximately 2 weeks for things to get ""better"" while on this drug. From 2 weeks until 6 weeks, you should gradually begin to feel the full effects. Around the 6 week mark, that will be your new normal.

I would schedule a follow up with your doctor around 4 to 6 weeks to discuss.

DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS DRUG ALL AT ONCE unless you have bad side effects. If you are looking to stop, my doctor suggested a gradual decrease. If you take 10mg daily, swap to half tablets. Then half tablets every other day. Then every third day.

With-in a few days I started to see the world in color again. I cried because I woke up and for the first time in years, everything was vibrant and no longer just shades of grey. I had been depressed so long I forgot the way color really looked. I started making it to work on time. I started texting people back again. I stopped wanting to die everyday. 

Anxiety- also a great experience. I could tell I missed a dose when I started re-counting meds over and over again at work, shaking, or having panic attacks. On this medication the constant panic and anxiety completely stopped. 

The issues….. I had to stop taking this medication. I gained almost 15 pounds in 6 months. This is significant for a girl my size. I had frequent urinary issues, my legs would severely swell, and I had hard lumps in my breasts. The doctors said there was no issues on my mammogram and they told me they could not find a reason for my leg swelling to be this severe after ultrasounds on my legs, blood tests and specialist appointments. I almost got to the point that I could not walk. Since stopping Medication a month ago as a trial, my leg swelling, painful breast lumps, and general leg pain have slowly but completely subsided just as my anxiety and depression has came back in full swing. 

In all- this was my third medication I tried . I feel that this medication is great for the reasons it is created for. If you’re lucky to not have terrible side effects, you probably will feel like a new person like I did. Read More Read Less  "

So that everyone doesn’t just think I’m a random, beaming Lexapro user who just had instant magical results, let me tell you that it took a FULL YEAR for me to love this medication. 

I started taking Lexapro after 9 years of crippling anxiety following a primary infection of CMV. I was literally fine one day with three small kids, sick with mono for two weeks, and couldn’t function normally ever again. (Until now.) For around a year following my illness, I had panic attacks constantly. For NO reason. Hungry. Panic attack. Adrenaline rush from almost slipping. Panic attack. Every little thing sent my nervous system into overdrive. Uncontrollably. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t actually worried about these things. After reading up how to handle post-viral fatigue and other issues, I began exercising, eating clean, etc. I spent nine years trying EVERYTHING to recover. Every little cold would put me out and I got sick constantly. All testing was normal. Thyroid. Vitamin levels. Autoimmune panels. Everything. 

I felt sick all of the time, everything sent me into terrifying panic attacks, and I was miserable. 

I dealt with it for nine long years. Depression started to sink in. Not even feelings of sadness or hopelessness. I just didn’t want to deal with panic attacks so I did nothing. I stayed in my comfort zone. After doing that for a long time, the sadness and hopelessness did set in. And then I started to struggle with sleep. After missing work one day for not sleeping for nearly a week, I decided to try meds. 

Lexapro. 

It was HELL. I took my first dose at night and passed right out. The first morning, I felt like I was in a dream. Everything looked and felt different and NOT in a good way. I felt awful. Sweats. Stomach ache. Head ache. So gross. I couldn’t eat. I would fall asleep at night fine and then wake up all night staring at the ceiling for no reason. I didn’t even realize I was awake for a while sometimes. Thinking back to the beginning of this drug gives me the creeps. (I started at 10 mg and was told to increase to 20 mg after 7 days. Absolutely NO way did I increase. I was horrified as it was.) I had intrusive thoughts. Weird thoughts. Depression was so much worse. 

On the other hand. No panic attacks. Immediately (to present day, I have not had one). 

I combed every inch of the internet for other people’s experiences. Videos. How long did it take to work? How long did it take to at least be in the positive area again. I felt sooooo much worse than when I started. I had to take a week off work because I was glued to the couch. 

My ex-husband is a psychiatrist and he suggested that unless I was having uncontrollable suicidal thoughts to stick it out. Ugh. 

I didn’t want to have sex. Nothing was enjoyable. Laying in bed didn’t even feel good. I started to tell myself that if I could make it another day, I’d be good. 

Weeks passed. Not much improvement. I toyed with increasing before giving up. But I couldn’t bear the thought of the adjustment period again. 

After maybe 3 months, I began to find tiny bits of “joy” in a few things. Eating. Watching a couple of shows. Still, I felt almost nothing. Numb to everything. No joy. No laughter. No sadness. No emotional reaction to anything. 

I started looking for some more positives… were there any?! I hadn’t been sick in a while. Which was unusual. I was sleeping through the night once in a while. Not staring at the ceiling anymore. 

Months passed. I started to notice “good” days. Not just good moments. But bad days were still the majority. 

Months passed. My sex drive started returning. Good days started to be equal to bad days. I started willingly going places with people. I started a business with a friend. A successful one. 

Months passed. Good days outnumbered bad days. Some numbness still. But I was able to feel some again too. 

A year later: 
I don’t have bad days. Like, I have human bad days, but not depression bad days. I love sex agaiRead More Read Less  "

It was the worst couple months I have ever had in my life. Naturally, living like this also made me depressed. I started paxil and it took 10 weeks for me to start feeling better. I have NOT had one panic attack since being on paxil. I take 30 milligrams. After a year in, I'm sleeping through the night, working full time, and fully functional! I am happy and living a life with purpose. My brain and body feel calm and at peace. Paxil genuinely saved me. My only lasting side effects are: mild weight gain and crazy dreams.

You shouldn't come off any psch meds by yourself. Which is better on the liver 3 pill combo vs a 1/4th to 1/2 of a 5mg klonipin that doesn't make you loopy stupid like the paxil combo.

I did have issues with nausea etc. so I snapped it in two and took 5 mg in the morning, 5 mg at night.  Works great - went from climaxing after 30 seconds to lasting  3 to 4 minutes.  My doctor then wanted me to try 20 mg but on that dose for a week or so I could not climax at all.  Then she tried me on 15 [1 10 mg plus 1/2 of a 10 mg].

3559,Prozac Oral,1/16/2024,13-18,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Depression,2.7,3,4,1,"Prozac is good in terms of getting rid of anxiety and some parts of depression. Other than that, it is a horrible drug that has even worse side effects. The reason I had to take this is because of horrible irrepressible thoughts triggered by a traumatic event that my parents put me through. I will start off with the fact that after 3 weeks of taking this medication (for me), I felt like I was disassociating from reality at a rapid rate. I felt like a zombie that could no longer feel emotion or anything of that nature. I have been off of Prozac for about two months now and I cannot feel emotions to the effect that I could before I took it. Also, Prozac has completely and utterly obliterated my sex drive, and given me erectile dysfunction (I know.. amazing right!?!?) It has also impacted my confidence and as an aspiring model, that's definitely not something I needed. I don't get excited for anything anymore, nothing makes me happy anymore, I can barely cry, and I want to kill myself more than ever :) Please, for me, never torture yourself by taking this medicine.Read More Read Less  "

A lot of my symptoms were helped but I was still having these sick horrific thoughts. I mentioned this to my therapist and she said the thoughts sounded like those with OCD. I started looking into this as I was under the impression like so many that OCD was mainly ""hand washing"" compulsions. What it described was me. I mentioned it to my psychiatrist and he agreed with my therapist and weaned me off Lexapro and onto Prozac. It took a few months to get up to 80mg that I take each morning. After 40 years I can't say I feel normal because I don't know what ""normal"" is. But the depression, anxiety, anger outbursts and my OCD thoughts have gotten manageable.

3579,Surmontil Oral,9/26/2012,45-54,Female,10 years or more,Patient,Depression,4.7,5,4,5,"I have a history of cyclical depression with a strong anxiety component. I cannot take SSRI's because there is a strong history of Bi-polar in my family, which contraindicates their use. My depression and anxiety used to be treated with major and then minor tranquilisers.  They did nothing but mask the symptoms. Surmontil has literally given me a full and balanced life. In depressive episodes I take 50mg nightly, but as maintenance I take 25mg continually, a sub-clincial dose, which has hugely reduced my depressive episodes to averagely one every five years rather than one every year. It has a strong anti-anxiety component and aids restful, dream filled sleep, something sleeping pills cannot do. If I even feel my emotional boat tipping, or I have a run of bad nights I up my dose to 50mg for a couple of nights till sleep is established again and then return to the sub-clinical dose. I couldn't recommend it more highly. I am now exploring it's use with my doctor as a treatment for nerve pain. I have a long term neurological condition and noticed that on the higher dose my nerve pain eased. I want to depend less on long term painkillers and Surmontil may help me do this. It has far fewer side effects than Lyrica for instance so this is worth exploring for me. It does make me feel extra hungry which has led to weight gain in the past, but I now go to bed soon after taking it and this avoids the munchies kicking in. For the right patient this is a wonderfully safe anti-depressant whose anti anxiety component kicks in straight away and which has none of the side effects that SSRI's can often cause in the initial few weeks.Read More Read Less  "
3580,Surmontil Oral,8/26/2011,55-64,Male,10 years or more,Patient,Depression,4.3,4,5,4,For me Surmontil was quite easy to take. Of all the antidepressants none worked as well as this medication. It just took 300 mg for it to give me full relief from a very bad depression. I was treated for a year by different Psychiatrist who prescribed it at  200 mg. Didn't work well at all. He tried Trazodone and Ascenden. Both at fairly high doses. This led to me recieving ECT. He did not provide this treatment so he turned me over to new and younger Psychiatrist who did.  ECT worked within one week. Later the depression while not as bad returned. He decided to up my dosage up to 300 mg. I was   doubtful that it do any good but in 2 and 1/2 weeks it kicked in and I felt great. I realize that I was taking a big dose but I wonder how many patients are victims of over  cautious MDs. I had no heart problems with this med or anything else accept a good night sleep every night. Surmontil worked for me but  if it wasn't for the MD increasing the dose to its maximum it would have been a treatment failure!Read More Read Less

We need to reform our failed healthcare system. America is the greatest nation on earth...In my lifetime (50 yrs) I've seen physicians make housecalls and actually know the pts. family!

Wellbutrin was supposed to help with that I was once told. Not really seeing that effect. Overall I like the med and how I feel on it.

3648,Wellbutrin XL Oral,2/4/2023,25-34,Female,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Depression,4.0,4,5,3,"I was on this for almost 5 years. I was very depressed when the psychiatrist gave me this, and it seemed to kick in right away. I felt great for a few weeks on it. Increased mood, productivity, and increased sex drive and better orgasms. As time went on, the effects began to lessen to where I no longer felt that it made much of a difference. I was on 300mg and I was not going to increase it, but I continued taking it. 
Looking back, I think it elevated my anxiety because I started avoiding people on the street thinking they would attack me after watching some True Crime youtube videos, and I started experiencing a fear of flying when I had never been afraid to get on a plane before. Then last spring, my dad was diagnosed with myeloma, which gave me severe health anxiety. My anxiety was through the roof, I had panic attacks, and literally felt like I would die any minute. There was a tiger in the bushes and I needed to flee. My GP ordered a blood test and they found a very high amount of Wellbutrin in my system. She decreased my dose to 150mg. I then discussed it with a new psychiatrist and he told me to stop taking it. From my own research, I concluded that, since it acts on noradrenaline, it was basically keeping me in fight or flight at all time. I told my doctor this and he said that was correct. My anxiety got so much better after I stopped Wellbutrin.

Bottom line: if you just have depression, it's good. If you also have anxiety, I would advise you to stay away or get a low dosage until you find out how it affects you.Read More Read Less  "

I’m a very healthy 25 year old and this drug, on the FOURTH DAY of taking it, caused me a lot of harm. I was driving home, everything was totally fine, not stressed at all, and then ALL of a sudden- I got dizzy, couldn’t breathe, and almost passed out. Luckily I was able to quickly pull over and call 911. At this point I was shaking uncontrollably, couldn’t swallow my own spit, hyperventilating and still feeling like passing out. My hands and feet were purple and freezing. For the first time in my life I had to go to the ER, and was taken there in an ambulance. Once getting there, for a little while I felt pretty calm, so I thought I should probably just go home instead of being treated. But shortly after, another of these “panic attack” type things came on. This repeated 5 more times at the hospital while they ran tests. (Everything came back normal but blood pressure was very high as well as my pulse at times).  eventually they gave me Ativan and then shot me up with Midazolam (a sedative) in order to get my heart rate back down. It was truly terrifying, I was really scared that I was going to have a seizure or something or even die. Reading some of these reviews of the times it worked for people made me really want to try out this anti-depressant but PLEASE re-consider if you want to save yourself thousands of dollars in ER bills. If this can happen to a healthy 25 year old, it can happen to anyone. Read More Read Less  "

By the 2nd week, I felt better, more enthusiastic and headache & nausea was gone. Despite not being sad anymore, I still didn’t feel happy. It was like an in between; however it did help minimize my anxiety & irritability. Now fast forward a month later and my MD increased my dose to 350mg. I have reverted back to my depressed self prior to starting the medication all together. Not sure if it’s temporary but it’s been a week now and I’m fighting back tears throughout the day and I’m nauseous all the time with occasional headaches & loss of motivation.

For the first few months on Wellbutrin at 150mg, I noticed a high heart rate, dilated pupils (so light sensitivity), and I had a very hard time sleeping. I didn't drink much but when I did I would have a terrible headache the next day which didn't happen before. BUT after 3 months these symptoms almost all but left. My libedo returned, my mood stabilized and I had a lot more energy in the morning. I also found I had less food cravings which was nice cause I would tend to overeat when I was in a mood.

Only recently have I noticed myself getting used to Pexeva. I experiences all the side effects but only two side effects still bother me: loss of hunger and nightly teeth grinding. I weigh 105 pounds and have to make sure I eat regularly, or I will forget. I grind my teeth everynight and it disturbs people sleeping in the next room. Wearing a night guard is all I can do to stop the damage I'm causing myself. Other than that, Pexeva put stability back in my life. It allowed me to live my life, free of depression, anxiety and obsessive tendencies. I wasnt pointlessly angry anymore or stuck running circles in my mind.

My insurance company required a generic after a short time on the Brand medication and Budeprion was substituted. This was a long time ago, but it was so ineffective, I bit the proverbial bullet and paid for the Brand Wellbutrin and have been for many years now. Terrific medication but $232/month for twice daily dosage. I recently changed to a new insurance policy and the brand copay went up from $50 the first month to $252 the second month. I learned from my pharmacist that there was in fact a generic Bupropion now ($4/month) and I decided to try it and after a week and a half, so far so good. The pills even look nearly the same as the brand Wellbutrin.

Insomnia was another symptom, but yeah overall the symptoms I had before was way worse when I got on these for only two days which I called the DR and was able to get off them despite some mild anxiety and “brain zaps”, gas too. It just didn’t work to help me and I personally just recommend anything without medication since it’s dangerous to take meds involving the brain than any other part of the body. It’s a gamble and not one to risk. If it was an actual mental health medicine, I don’t think it should make you feel bad at all just to wait weeks or even never to be “feeling better”.

I was prescribed 10mg Celexa daily for anxiety, and started off by taking 5mg for 8 days to start. On the 9th day, I took 10 mg (keep in mind this is the minimum dosage) and I had a complete overdose and nervous system reaction. It started with what felt like my skin burning, I had emptied my guts from diarrhea in about 20 minutes, my legs were stiff, my anxiety was through the roof, my heart was racing, and I had insane shivers. The worst symptom was the skin burning and I felt like my skin was on fire while I was shivering. I went to the hospital and turns out my blood pressure was dangerously high, being 171 over 110. They gave me 2mg of lorazepam and within 10 minutes I was knocked out, and after a little bit of sleeping myself and my blood pressure were back to normal. It was definitely scary, but I do not regret taking it. I don't know if the Celexa truly helped me or not, but shortly after that incident my anxiety started to go away, and I rarely have anxiety attacks anymore. When I do I just take .5 mg of lorazepam.

I had just retired and experienced the loss of a close family member so my doctor prescribed this medication as more of a deterrent for depression, I believe, since I've been treated for depression in the past. Not sure how it helped, or even if it did, but my doctor is great so I followed her advice. I took it for a little over a year. I knew it was time to stop when I realized that I literally couldn't cry. It basically totally numbed my emotions and I'd rather feel things now and then even if they're sometimes unpleasant.

At 1st i didnt think it was working because i swear i was more anxious for a cple of weeks. i had a lot of anxiety but wasnt having full on panic attacks. I was just constantly in that limbo stage. But before i started taking it i was having panic attacks daily just driving the car would trigger one. going out to eat i would have to go in the bathroom to try and calm down. then started getting them in my safe place at home. thats when i seeked help because i wasnt able to control when the panic attacks would trigger. i knew the stress and depression is what orginally started the anxiety . But having full on panic attacks that come out of nowhere makes u wanna die. well i should say it makes u feel like ur dying ! so ive been on celxa going on 3 months now and im starting to feel back to my normal self . i thought i was going to permantly be like that and i was just losing my self along with reality.  so to sum all this up im really thankful i seeked help and was giving this medication to balance all this out.Read More Read Less

3723,Celexa Oral,7/27/2022,25-34,Female,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Panic Disorder,5.0,5,5,5,"I always struggled with anxiety and depression, but I lived with it for years. During the spring of 2021 I began having horrible panic attacks every time I left my house. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, and I cried nonstop. Nothing really triggered this but it might have been a result of the pandemic. Before this, I had a job where I traveled across the country months on end and was fine but then my anxiety completely changed me. I couldn’t leave my bed room without having a panic attack. I stopped seeing friends, going out…I couldn’t even work or go see the doctor. I finally ended up at urgent care after a bad episode where they gave me hydroxozine but that made it worse. FINALLY I got in to see a doctor and he prescribed me 10mg Celexa.
I’m going to honest, at first it was awful. I would say the first 2-3 weeks I didn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat so I lost a ton of weight, and I felt jittery and anxious 24/7. My doctor encouraged me to stick with it and give it a month or two. He also gave me trazadone to help with sleeping. I remember coming on here and reading all the reviews and feeling defeated because I thought it wasn’t going to work.
After around a month I started to notice a difference. I wasn’t waking up in a panic, my brain fog went away, I wasn’t feeling jittery or anxious 24/7. It was gradual, I didn’t just wake up and feel better one day. I also went to therapy which helped a lot. And around month 3 they moved me to 20mg.  I’ve been on it for over a year now and it truly has changed my
life. I feel like myself again. I go out, I have fun, and I rarely if ever have panic attacks. Things that would make me anxious before my
panic disorder don’t bother me anymore. I feel levelheaded and more myself than ever.
So if you’re worried about starting or have started and feel bad, stick with it!!!! Work with your doctors and don’t stay up late in the night like I did reading every negative review you can find. Celexa has really really helped me and I’m so happy to be on it. Read More Read Less  "
3724,Celexa Oral,6/15/2022,45-54,Female,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Anxiousness associated with Depression,5.0,5,5,5,"I have struggled on and off through adulthood with anxiety and obsessive thoughts. I had a major episode after the birth of my child 20 years ago. My doctor at that time put me on Prozac, which helped, but took a long time to start working and had some undesirable side-effects. When I had another major episode 5 years ago, my new doctor prescribed Celexa (Citalopram) 40mg and it was a miracle for me!  It started to work very quickly - within the first 2 weeks (much faster than Prozac) and had far fewer side-effects. I have been slowly decreasing my dosage over the years and now take 10mg per day, and that is enough to keep the trouble at bay. I haven't had a single episode since starting Celexa.  I also exercise daily to keep the stress low and eat a healthy diet.

When I returned from my trip, I immediately made an appointment with the clinic I had been going the past year, but a new doctor saw me….thank goodness! She asked why I was prescribed the various medications, and what worked. I said the only thing that came close was the Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen mix. She said she wanted me to try Duloxetine (yesterday) and I’ll be an SOB, no Sciatica pain today!

3757,Duloxetine Oral,6/18/2023,45-54,Female,6 months to less than 1 year,Patient,Major Depressive Disorder,4.3,5,4,4,"I have been taking Duloxetine for about a year. It really helped pull me out of a rough patch with depression, tearfulness and anxiety. I felt much more steady, optimistic and resilient, and got through the dark winter without my usual SAD symptoms. I think it also reduced my chronic pain from spinal stenosis. 
I started at 20mg and then 30, and did endure nausea and some sedating effects for a while but that went away after a week or two. Taking it at night helped. It also caused mild constipation but that’s basically a benefit for me because I tend to have the opposite problem. 
I was worried about nausea when I increased to 60mg last fall, but it didn’t come back. What did start to happen after several months at 60mg were *drenching* night sweats. It took me a while to identify the meds as the cause and that’s when I started to get acquainted with how hard it can be to come off this drug. I had the brain zaps, electric shock sensations, and diarrhea for withdrawal symptoms. Titrating down very gradually over several months made it manageable. Now I’m taking 20 mg daily and I think I’ll stick with that for a while, and I expect I’ll want to increase the dosage before winter comes again, but not up to 60mg again. 
Overall I think the benefits of this medication outweighed the downsides for me. I couldn’t tolerate SSRIs that I had tried first (3 different ones gave me insomnia and diarrhea. My pscych said they were probably too alerting/stimulating for me). Unfortunately it often takes some trial and error before you find the best fit for a psych drug, which is hard to go through when you just need relief!

And each and every time I said no. I do not have depression nor do I suffer from anxiety. This went on for a few years from one network of doctors to another. I finally caved and agreed to take it. I took it for a couple months. Did it work? Absolutely. Almost too good. I felt amazing. I bought a mountain bike and began to ride. I bought a surf board and hit the weights again. Then… I ran out while waiting on a physician authorization for refill and had to go out of town which equaled a cold turkey scenario.  THATS when the hell began. I was unaware of the massive withdrawal I had just thrust myself headlong into. No doctor, no not ONE warned me about the dangers of withdrawal and that you literally need a “taper plan” monitored by your doctor to stop taking this.  Just google “quitting cymbalta” or “cymbalta withdrawal” and read some articles BEFORE you begin taking it. The “shocks” are REAL and they hurt. And the wonderful bouquet of other related symptoms are quite real and inescapable as well. I treat my pain symptomatically now and deal with it.

I was diagnosed with GAD (after struggling with anxiety my entire life, but never really talking about it to my dr). I had a nightmare experience trying multiple anti-depressants that did NOT work. There went 6 months of my life. I was existing in a fog, and life was starting to feel hopeless. I was prescribed Cymbalta 30 mg, and I had very little side effects in the beginning. After one week on this drug my life took a turn for the better and I began feel like a better version of myself. I felt so great after a few months, I thought I was cured of my anxiety and didn't need any drugs, so tapered off with really no side-effects (I hadn't read the horrible tapering side-effect reported here- maybe that's part of the reason I didn't have any? The mind is a powerful thing!). Fast-forward a few months and I was deep in the pits of darkness again, anxiety controlling my life. I'm back on Cymbalta again, only 30 mg, but it makes such a difference. Honestly, I really wish I didn't need drugs to feel normal, but there are all types of medical issues that require medication, and I realize, I probably need this drug to exist in the world the way it is. I have some kind of imbalance in my brain, the same way a diabetic can't make insulin. This drug was a life raft when I was drowning. Now I have my head above water, life makes sense again.

During my second infusion I had a terrible reaction. A sharp pain ran from the nape of my neck down my spine and out to all my limbs. I was paralyzed by the pain and called out for help. Oncology nurses ran over and said that I had a reaction to the Taxotere and that my infusion rate needed to be slowed down etc. I was able to take Taxotere for the duration of my 5 chemo cycles but the infusions lasted 6 hours each visit. I was told that my name was added to ""a list"" but was not given any further information. In the months and now 2 years  that followed, I suffered from mild neuropathy in my feet and hands but what was worse was this gnawing pain in my back that has progressively gotten worse. I wasn't even able to take a shower because the water hurt my back as it came out of the shower head. I began to ask my oncologist what this pain was and he seemed baffled and didn't make any connection to the Taxotere incident whatsoever. Each time I mentioned it, he refuted that it was safe and not related. I had numerous MRIs and a PET scan, a full spinal x-ray series, CT scans and even a thorasic spinal epidural to try and relieve the pain and find the root of my pain. All came back that I was fine. With no further answers and help from my oncology team, I decided to seek help from other specialsist. I am now being seen by a Pain Management doctor who is treating my pain as nerve damage from the Taxotere. I am on heavy doses of pain meds and have drastically altered my quality of life. The pain is more manageable than it had been earlier, but it is ever present and masked by medication. I was NEVER informed that chronic nerve damage in my back could be a possible side effect. I have since connected online with others who have suffered with severe pain following Taxotere usage. I am cancer free, but in pain!Read More Read Less  "

He got diagnosed with stage 4 small cell lung cancer with metastasis in the liver and lymph nodes on Father’s Day 2018. He immediately began targeted chemo therapy and radiation. After his first round of chemo they did a new CT scan and PET scan, miraculously the doctor said the cancer is reduced to scarring and continued the radiation preventively. 3 months later he is back in the hospital and things are not looking good but he is still stable at this point. His oncologist suggested this medication. WHICH IS NOT YET FDA APPROVED (despite having previously told my father to avoid anything that is not FDA approved). I supported my father in whichever steps he took but I was reluctant about this medication. From the first dose it was a rapid decline. Like I said he was stable before and after he began this medication absolutely everything went horribly wrong. He couldn’t eat, sleep, he felt more short of breath than he did when he had 900 cc’s of fluid in his lungs. This is medical malpractice. I can’t help but feel that they used my dad as some sort of lab rat to test this on. I know that cancer is terrifying and I know that you may feel there are not many options, but please consider finding another option than this medication.

This combo was just approved right before i stated taking it. I had two dose of the combo drug and got very sick. I experienced most of the rare side effects. 1st it was the colitis which landed me in the hospital for about 1 week with severe dehydration. Next was swelling of my knees it was so severe it they needed to be drained weekly. Next side effect was Stephen Johnson's syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis which basically almost killed me. The toxic rash spread over 90% of my body and I was not responding to meds. Three weeks in the ICU burn unit and I was told I could no long have the immunotherapy. Almost 6-7 months of just heeling, I had another pet scan that showed the tumor had spread to another area. At this point i still needed to heal and they scheduled a new pet scan in three months. So the week before Christmas this year, we had that scan, for days later I was given the results. The immuniotherapy worked, I was CANCER FREE! These meds made me very very sick and almost killed me but in the end, I am a 45 year old father that will be able to see his children grow up!

My dad started opdivo 12/21/17, second dose 1/4/18.  After the second dose, he started going downhill bad.  He wasnt this bad after 6 mo's of chemo!!!!  After the 3rd dose, his abdomen started bloating in the liver area, he got weak, then had facial drooping.  We told the oncologist and he suggested steroids then another dose after a week delay.  One more dose, my dad was barely walking, slurred speech, barely eating, increased edema in abdomen and legs.  Then at 4am, my mom calls me.  My dad somehow made it to the kitchen and couldnt stand, couldnt walk, could barely talk!!!!  We called an ambulance and sat in ER, then admitted to hosp.  The next morning, he was transferred to the local VAMC, palliative care floor.  He died 2 days later.    I do not believe opdivo was working, but rather attacking healthy cells instead of the cancer!!!!  I will never ever recommend opdivo to anyone!!!    Opdivo killed my dad.  I think if they had just stayed with regular chemo he would still be alive!!!Read More Read Less  "

I DO NOT recommend working through this treatment; it was absolutely brutal.  I'm now on disability taking Taxol with Avastin every week and it's a breeze in comparison!

Drug removed, given nitroglycerin and aspirin with immediate pain relief. Chemo oncologist said reaction was heart related and refused to administer second round of chemo as this could cause a heart attack. Pt scan looked clear, but cancer returned to other lymph nodes the next year. Radiation and cysplatin were the treatments. Clear scan followed. There are no other drugs to use if cancer returns. Certainly wish there was more research for this type of cancer. Cannot find any new studies. Perhaps because this is rare, no one is working on another cure.

I am currently taking 3 pills twice a day and have hardly any side effects.  I take good care of my feet so I don't get Hand and Foot Syndrome again, putting lotion on at least once a day, shoes off after walk, watch for redness and ice them if I overdo it (i.e. play tennis then do yard work when it is hot).  The other effects are minor constipation but I eat wheat cereal and maybe take an extra probiotic later in the day.  The thing that bugs me the most is the red spots that appear on face and arms, esp. since it is Summer and hot here.  Apricot scrub helps reduce them quickly.

Also, developed a rash on chest, upper arms and back and face which was relieved by Kenalog creme (0.1%) quickly.   HFS 90% better after 4 days of using the 10% Urea lotion 3x/day (Cetaphil is inexpensive).  I seem to have less of a quesy stomach if I eat better, cutting out the junk food.  My off weeks were nice with none of the effects from cycle 1 above.  In summary,  it seems that drinking 1-2 qts. of water,  elevating off my feet hours per day, applying lotion 3x/day to hands and feet and eating well has helped me to have less side effects in these first 2 cycles.

*Started 10% Urea lotion again 3x a day once HFS started.  I feel like it could have been prevented if I would have kept up with the 3x/day I did 1st few weeks and drinking close to 2 qts. of water plus not taking such hot showers.   I had read if using that lotion for 1st 6 weeks of treatment, it can prevent HFS.

For the first couple of months everything seem to have been ok but slowly I started with this warm red rash and swelling on my hands, feeds and then my face started to swell up with the same warm rash and came with chills and body aces. I ended up at ER and the doctors there told me that I might have some kind of autoimmune disease. Had to see Rheumatologist. She did a bunch of blood tests (waiting for results) but also told me that I might be allergic to the BP med and should switch. I have switched to a different BP med (Amlodipine) and with that one I started immediately with racing/pounding heartbeat, light headed and a swelling. Therefore, I figured my body does not like any of these Bb meds. So I decided to stop taking the meds and start with a healthy, high potassium diet.. I will see what happens but warning, if you experience any of the above reactions, please consult your Doctor. You know your body best! Also, I am so grateful for these reviews, It helped me a lot in figuring out what is wrong with me.

I found myself getting tired very easily when on walks, my muscles ached so quickly, and I'm generally quite healthy, very active lifestyle, but these pills took that from me.
These pills also played havoc on my bowels, I had severe stomach aches, green liquid poop for 3 days after 1 pill, and increased difficulty holding that poop- it would make it so all of a sudden I would NEED the bathroom lest I mess my pants- this made me afraid to leave the house as I could not be far from a toilet or I'd be in a terrible panic.
Overall, these pills can probably help you but they have some very specific side effects that can affect very specific anxieties or other issues. This medication may be for you,  but not if you're anxious, dissociative, have eating issues, or any bowel problems.

It made me lose my appetite and also cause my breathing to be very shallow. I am not sure how I was able to make it taking that long. Long story short, I stopped taking it after the two weeks because I suspected that  the beta blockers were giving me severe side effects. After not taking them for a week I started having nightmares and the tingling in my hands and feet lingered.

Suffered from terrible performance and social anxiety for many years. Timing an dosage make a huge difference, so I sugget trying differnent strategies if its not working for you. 
I take 20mg in the morning. For the first hour I feel a little weird (tired, brain fog), but after that hour, that 20mg lasts me the entire day. 
I give briefs to large audiences all day now, with no issues. Before, it was terrible. Blushing, high heartrate, clammy hands, cant talk or thing...etc. 

With 20mg in the morning, its been fantasitic. I have had to take another 10mg later in the day sometimes if I have a big event late. 

Side effects are mild for me (tired within 1st hour after taking it, cold hands and feet).

Ask doctor first but for me! :

Start for about 10-14 days on 25 mg!! Then cut the pill in equal halves! If stay on 25 mg or higher will have drastically low blood pressure magnifying problems you taking this medicine for!! It is FAST ACTING. Take on time … 22-23 hours later you start to feel it weaning off. Do not forget to take this medicine.

DO NOT forget to take this medicine!! You can pass out or get a heart attack. 

It is something you can get chemically addicted to but will take LONG time for dependence even in prone people. 

You can eventually cut pill into 1/3 or even 1/4 for weeks or indefinitely to WEAN OFF.

WEAN OFF -DO NOT FORGET DAILY DOSE OR RISK HEART ATTACK.

also continue or add a new long-term treatment plan or medicine with this & the withdrawal effects will be none to mild if your condition allows!Read More Read Less  "

I have had 3 kids since & the HBP seemed to be situational. But,recently, it's been consistently high. I eat well, am active,and don't like taking pills for this exact reason. My dr prescrbd Atenolol & w/in 2 days, my right foot was lightly puffy & tingling. It was sore from a few days b4, so I did not make the connection. Until Day3 when both legs - knees to toes - looked worse than being 9 mo pregnant. Painfully numb...pins & needle sensations. Clothes could not get past my ankles, forget any shoes besides flip flops. In dresses or skirts,my ankles looked like a 6 pack of hot dogs. Skin taute n shiny, waddling, unable to breathe. I was told this was an 'Uncommon' side effect, stop taking asap, and go to the ER or Walk In ER clinic since it was the weekend. I was gasping for air-unable to get a good breath. Brutal. Kidney pain. I went to the ER and was diagnosed w/ Bilateral Lower Extremity Edema. Its been 9 days and everything has gone back down except my feet which waiver from worsening to improving. The Dr said my feet will be the last areas to heal 100% being they are the farthest, distance wise, away and absorbtion is needed. I noticed they significantly reduce in swelling when they are wrapped or in a sneaker, which barely fits over my foot. Elevating and icing doesnt do much quick enough. The DR even said that this med usually isn't a first choice for a primary. One w/ a diuretic is standard, if your blood panel works within those parameters. He even asked if a nurse or assistant wrote the prescription instead - the baffled looks has ignited my search for a diff, more thorough primary.

For the first few weeks after I started taking it, I was dizzy all the time, and a little anxious but that's all gone away. I continue to take it and have not had any afib episodes since so I am happy. It also lowered my blood pressure so that's a bonus. 

I have also quit drinking alcohol and really cut back on my caffeine. Read More Read Less  "
3992,Metoprolol Tartrate Oral,5/3/2023,65-74,,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Ventricular Rate Control in Atrial Fibrillation,4.7,4,5,5,"According to my Cardiologist, this does not cure afib  and other related arrhythmias, but calms the heart to reduce numbers of attacks and make you more comfortable during attacks.  For me it has done the job so far.  My afib is the kind  that stops you in your tracks and can last 6 to 12 hours or more.  This has been reduced to once every couple of months with metropolol..  Dosage is 25mg split between morning and evening.  It has also reduced my borderline high blood pressure down.  The lower blood pressure can sometimes make you feel a little fatigued, but it is not that noticeable.  You should also quit or cut down on alcohol if you are on this drug or have afib.  Near beer is now the standard, with only a real beer every once and a while. Read More Read Less  "

I was put in the emergency room for a rapid heartbeat after a bad reaction to some cough medicine. I was in the hospital for 4 days and they prescribed  25 mg twice A-day.  The most noticeable side effect for me was crushing fatigue and just feeling like a zombie. I have very significant brain fog and I just don't feel like I think clearly. I have developed very bad IBS, a chronic  long term pain in my stomach and upper back, Horrible acidic diarrhea Sometimes as much as 20 times A-day. Eventually this led to having my gallbladder removed.  The symptoms have improved but every time I take the medicine within an hour I am in the bathroom. I have also experienced a large amount of hair loss, and a significant loss of sexual desire.  I have become gluten intolerant, dairy intolerant and beef intolerant.  I have terrible acid reflux And I have no tolerance for heat. I feel like my legs and arms are weak. I am glad I found this page because it makes me really question The safety of this medicine for me. It does control my heart rate but it drops to levels that I am really uncomfortable with. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and my heart rate is 58.So yesterday I cut my medicine down to 12 and a 1/2 in the morning and 12 and a 1/2 at night. I'm going to see if this doesn't doesn't drop  my heart rate so low. I know everyone's body chemistry is different and we all react differently but for some people the side effects are very harsh. I have decided I'm going to talk to my cardiologist about the ablation procedure. I have made some pretty significant changes since I 1st was diagnosed doing this VT. I have lost 40 pounds, I have left my high stress job as an over the road trucker, I have learned to say no to other people and do what is best for me and I  Have made other dietary changes.. I allow myself to have one cup of coffee in the morning and no other caffeine. I have also released my sugar consumption and gone gluten and dairy free.  I honestly think if I had not quit gluten I would be disabled today. I think the best thing we can all do is find a good doctor who will listen to our concerns and not run us through the mill.  The last time I saw my cardiologist he was literally in the room with me for 3 minutes. I do not consider this quality of care care and I am going to find someone else i do not consider this quality of care  and I am going to find someone else. I wish you all the best.Read More Read Less  "

After trying everything else (Diovan, Accupril, Tekturna, Toprol, and furosemide) I left my cardiologist who had thrown up his hands in frustration.  I saw a nephrologist who sent me for an MRI where they found an adenoma on the left adrenal, pumping out noxious substances into the blood stream.  5 mg of Amiloride a day brought the blood pressure down to 109/63!

When I use the one at the grocery store, sometimes it's high, sometimes it's normal.

Um...no, I'm healthy. Even more, I'm fit. I just rowed 2k in 7:05, at the age of 55. I'm not at all worried about my heart or my lungs. 
Could something bad happen? Sure. But I'm sure not going to be a slave to a damn pill that seems to have no impact on anything so far. The idea of taking a pill for a month to see if it does something, and then having to consult with a doctor that loves to peddle pills to get off the stuff.. that makes no sense to me. 
As far as I can tell, this pill does nothing for me. And from what I read of the potential side-effects, I don't think it's worth the risk.

Well, I have a sensitive system to drugs. This one seemed to work but then 2 months into it, was having pain and a lot more nausea from it, Clonidine has made me feel like throwing up since day 1 along with not sleeping well, worse dry eyes and mouth, but would get pains in the upper abdomen and feel really sick. Thought it was from taking Naproxen for the arthritis when the clouds get real bad, but I only take this when needed, so I stopped taking Naproxen or even Excedrin Extra Strength for my migraines.

Got bloodwork done late february and the bilirubin level was slightly elevated. I was like, hmmmm, the last time this happened it was from taking valerain root to help with pain and it elevated the bilirubin slightly. So stopped taking that, did a cleansing of liver and the level came back down to normal. Well, yesterday I ended up in the ER from the pain and nausea being so bad, this gets worse and worse, as well as throwing up. It feels like I'm backing up. There are now 2 elevated bilirubin levels. So, I'm stuck because I have to wean off of this and when I try to take it, this litterally makes me vomit. The doctors will tell you Clonidine doesn't do this, but it will.

I found a new Doctor who ran a full range blood test and I found my A1c was 7.2, yep Diabetic. I was prescribed metformin and within days had loads of energy, I looked up the effects of the two drugs together and what I found was various studies and something I was not expecting. It was found that Clonidine raised sugar in the blood by 108% in the non diabetic group and lowering of Insulin production, this seemed to be the case in many studies but did not give me a range I could understand.

Initially it seemed to help for about three days. After that side effects started mounting. First came constipation. Shortly after that a dull pain started in my abdomen. The pain got so bad and was accompanied by a feeling of fullness so bad that I could barely eat food. The fullness got so intense it started to affect my breathing which had become shallow. Then came the heart palpitations which made me stop taking it. My blood pressure rose from 120/70 to 165/95 and the side affects continued for a couple weeks coming in waves. additional side effects of withdrawal from clonidine like hot flashes, headaches and redness in the face and hands started as I stopped the clonidine. I was only taking .1 milligram split in two doses morning and night. After a couple weeks it got better. Once I was better I decided to give it another shot only taking .025 doses twice a day. Within three days the side effects started coming back. That told me it was definitely the medicine. Here I am a week later. Mostly better. Still stomach pain, headaches, hot flashes. Haven’t had a bowel movement in three days. If the doctor prescribes you this get a second opinion. It really was only approved by the fda for emergency hypertension in the 60’s. Who knows if this stuff would even pass fda approval if they tried to get it thru now. I would be careful about going off label with this. Even at low doses this can have toxic effects on some people. My experience mirrors many of the other bad experiences I have seen on this review board. I am not the kind of person that writes reviews on medication but felt compelled to issue this warning. DONT WAIT FOR THE SIDE EFFECTS TO GET BAD!

I feel it made me age 10 years in 6 months. I tried halving the dose at my doctor's recommendation. It doesn't work as well (more arrhythmia) but I feel so much more like my good old self otherwise. A choice of between a rock and a hard place. Is there any research about what would help us diminish these side effects?Read More Read Less  "

About six weeks after starting the Sular I began to have excessive swelling in my feet, ankles and lower legs up to about three inches of the knee.  The swelling would be severe by evening and began turning my feet and legs bright red.  I cannot over emphasize how bad this was.   When I got up in the morning my feet and legs would look almost normal.  My cardiologist ordered a ultra sound of my heart to make sure it was working O. K (I have four stints in my heart and was communicating through his nurse assistant).  The ultra sound was normal.  When I finally got to see the doctor personally he saw my legs he immediately stated the swelling was due to the Sular.  My legs would burn and itch and were generally uncomfortable all day. If you have any swelling in feet and legs and are on Sular get to your doctor (insist) immediately and get the Sular stopped.  It took a week using Lasix daily to get my legs back to normal.

I have tried to research are doing the same thing. They don't give me info on this site. I'm taking furosemide 40 mg. for water retention, spironolactone 25 mg. for water retention,bisoprolol 5mg. to slow heart rate and lower blood pressure and aliskiren 300 mg. for  high blood pressure. Had to stop spironolactone due to rectal bleeding and stomach pain. I am asthmatic and am really having hard time breathing after I take bisoprolol. I am going to slowly get off this drug, as I have found out that asthmatics should not be taking it. The doctor that prescribed this drug knows I am an asthmatic. Now I'm being sent to a asthma doctor as my asthma is out of control. So they will probably add some more drug and then more side affects and the cycle continues. My blood pressure has dropped to a normal level and the water pills are draining the excess fluid away, but I am so fatigued I can hardly walk around my home let alone exercise or even have a sense of feeling well. I am so tired all the time and fall asleep sitting up. My Cardiologist said I will feel this way for at least  six months until my body adjusts to these pills. I just don't think one should feel so unwell from medications that are suppose to make you well.

This did reduce my BP at first, and seemed to be working very well for a few months.  However, a range of symptoms began to appearand take root nameley: swelling of ankles and lower legs; extreme depression and mood swings; increasing dizziness; lack of libido; insomnia; upper and lower back pain; body aches;chest pains (including palpitations);and finally, a lowering of my intellectual capacity (ie poor memory, inability to concentrate etc.) Please be warned that this drug CHANGED MY LIFE IN AVERY BAD WAY.

Having been recently told by my MD that my B/P is of a teenager's, I have endured tremedous suffering and pain. On a daily basis I go through a series of constant fatigue, hives/rashes, dizziness, flushing, INSOMMNIA, sweats and at times leg weakness or leg pains , including swelling from the knees to my ankles. I feel miserable and have no energy for anything. I push myself but it is only getting worse. Here's what I figured out since I have been on this med (approx 6-8 months). In the beginning it works really well with no notable side effects. However,as time goes on, the side effects begin to appear one at a time, becoming unbearable as time goes on. I beleive the manufacturing company purposely designed this med this way in order to get HBP suffers SOLD on its effectiveness and yet hiding the side effects that come on during theraputic use. I am now seeking a new Heart/ HBP Md that truely cares about his patients and not just what free golf outing or vacation he can get from the drug representative who convinces him to push POISON on to us patients. I am now suffering with ITP (lack of platelets) a blood disorder and I believe is as a result of this medication. Please use every precaution before and/or when using this Medication.

In the beginning, Azor worked wonderfully! Very little side effects. After a year of using this drug it became my worst nightmare. I began experiencing severe side effects. Irregular heart rhythm, itching, tingling, nausea, anxiety, the list goes on! I thought I was going to have a stroke or heart attack everyday for the last two years! Side effects were so severe, I spent the past two years doing very expensive and time-consuming test only to be told the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with my heart, my liver, gallbladder etc! Tons of test to find out the Azor was the cause of all of my medical issues. I had changed insurance companies and they would not pay for the Azor. So I was given a prescription for amlodipine and Benicar. I couldn't afford the Benicar so in the mean time I only had the Amlodopine to take. While I waited for my doctor to get back to me, after going a week without the olmesartan, I realized I hadn't had any heart palpitations and I felt like my old self again. That's when I realized it was the Azor! After two very scary years of E.R. visits, being told I had anxiety, and was paranoid, I find out that the Azor was the problem the whole time! Please do your research. I am sure had I not stopped this medication, it would have resulted in a worse outcome for me! I thank God that I was forced to go without it. Otherwise I may have never discovered what it was doing to me. Read More Read Less  "

Cardiologist is absolutely certain this is the med and dosage I need.  Does it slow the heart rate? Absolutely.  I get a slow pounding heart rate just getting up to go pee.  It drives my Oxygen out the bottom.  Been as low as 67%. Cardiologist says its my lungs, not my heart, and will not consider anything else. I disagree and he is fine with that.  My feet and ankles have swollen to dimensions never seen as part of my body.  Had to put on (painfully) compression hose.  Not helping with swelling.  Never had puffy feet before.  I need to come to a complete standstill for my Oxygen level to get back up while my heart rate is being held down by the medicine.

Now a hot pink colored nebivolol pill from ""SoCol"" a chinese company. My blood pressure skyrocketed instantly. My idiot family practice resident despite my protests then doubled the exact same pill. Now I am high 200's over high 100's. The next idiot family practice resident added 10mg amlodipine to the mess. That added major fluid retention to my woes and still too high blood pressure. Save us all because America's healthcare has collapsed-or else once you are Medicare it is open season on us.

Severe joint and muscle pain with fatigue. Couldn’t figure out what was going on and finally tried discontinuing the generic bystolic. It is been the third day and feeling much better. It may take a while to get back to where I was before the generic. Do not stop bystolic abruptly. I think the generic versions of this drug are dangerous. They are not equivalent to the brand name and may be toxic.. The FDA is a complete failure when it comes to foreign made generics.

The pain in my neck and head prompted me to take my Blood Pressure 208/83. For 3 days it stayed high and I was in wicked head pain. Thank God I had an old sample of Bystolic 10 mg. Today is my 3rd day on it and I am starting to feel a little better.My Doc is working with me to appeal my insurance to make an exception to pay for the brand. Trust me, the generics are not the same and it really pisses me off! I have had many instances where I had very bad side effects, no side effects with the brand name.

It’s like taking a placebo. My pharmacist gave me two weeks of name brand until I can get the rx refilled with name brand again. My bp is worse on 10 mg of generic than it was on 5 mg of name brand.

I'm only taking 5 mg. I've had some side effects such as wierd stomach feelings and sometimes body pain or a slight fatigue. Now I've noticed some people have sleep issues on this drug. The reason I chose it is because I heard it has much less of a propensity to inhibit melatonin release than the other beta blocker drugs. I have extreme chronic insomnia and with this drug I don't notice it affecting my sleep. If anything my sleep is kind of better and I prefer taking the med at night with my sleep meds.

Bystolic is cardio-selective and typically doesn't affect other organs like older BBs. It has worked very well at keeping BP and heart rate at good levels.  BP increased with palpitations about a year ago, and PCP was monitoring.  Instead of simply increasing dose he ordered a sleep study - turns out I had obstructive sleep apnea.  I'm not overweight, but it's likely age-related.  I had an oral appliance made that resolved the OSA, and BP dropped to 115/70 within a few weeks.  With PCP support I decreased to 2.5 mg, and BP is still great.  I would suggest to those experiencing increasing BP and weight gain on BP meds to consider having a sleep study before just throwing more meds at it.

In fact, the rash on my face had become so disfiguring during the final year before diagnosis that I rarely left my house and contemplated suicide on multiple occasions.

4423,Bystolic Oral,1/20/2019,45-54,,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,High Blood Pressure,3.0,3,3,3,This is my second time on Bystolic. The second time around I went from 2.5 mg to 5.0 mg.  The doubling of dose was due to my increased hypertension. At 5.0 I noticed a dramatic increase in extreme tiredness and dizziness.  I lost motivation to get my daily chores done.  The increase in dose really did not help decrease my high blood pressure either!  I gained 5 pounds right away and have been unable to drop any weight even with extended water fasts of 3 days.  I did more research on other natural paths of controlling my BP and discovered the miracles of Magnesium.  After just 3 days my BP went from 140-150 (systolic) to now 120-135.  Diastolic numbers greatly improved too.  I halved my bystolic down to 2.5 and have maintained 120/80 range.  My goal is to increase my stores of magnesium with time and hopefully kick the bystolic.  Bystolic does help with mood swings (menapause) and anxiety to some extent. Overall my low dose is tolerable.  Some headaches and heavy legs due to water retention has also been experienced. These side effects are tolerable.  Read More Read Less

(40-10 size) I read where this drug is typically over prescribed so I cut it in 1/2 and took my bp everyday- wow 1/2 was as good as the whole dose! If one is going to try this, be sure and keep a record of ur bp every day at same time.  I graph my bp and heart rate on excell.  I do notice my heart rate at rest is low (46-52 beats /minute but maybe it is due to my daily cycling.  Had stroke in 2005, I'm 69 but recovered well. Not sure it it works for everyone but I never any change in the data from whole pill to half pill.  Howeever i tried really hard to go for no salt (dash diet), exercise hard and dropped about 15 lbs trying to normalize bp.  The dash diet and weight loss really works.  Ideally i would like off this pill but it may be risky.  My next move is to drop to 1/4 see what happens    I do not like the drop in cycling power due to lower hr.  Typically i bike at 20-23km/hour with a hr of 120 for say 40-60 kms.  My hr will not get above 145.Read More Read Less  "

My BP is steady at 120-130 over ~80. I had swelling of one leg before taking the drug, and I have swelling of one leg now. I tried other BP medication prior to starting on Tribenzor and had a variety of side effects, none of which were acceptable. Any changes in physical ability or mental acuity I've experienced since beginning treatment with Tribenzor could just as easily be addressed as ""simply getting older,"" or the natural effects of aging.

It helps lower my blood pressure back to normal levels within the first month. It certainly helps lowering blood pressure. But I have experienced a side effect not listed on this drug. I have contracted Raynaudâ??s syndrome.  The reason I know this is because I contracted it with in the first month of taking this medicine. I lost my insurance for two years so I couldnâ??t take it and my Raynauds went away. Last year I got my insurance back and started taking Tribenzor again. My Raynaudâ??s syndrome came back with full force. I cannot take this medicine again.  Raynaudâ??s syndrome causes blood vessels to shrink making your fingertips toes and nose and tongue turn white and feel numb. If you are experiencing this check with your doctor.

The first thing the next morning you now RIGHT AWAY if he missed. Wow!  We switched health plans and now they are charging us $350 avg for month for 120 pills.  I just looked at the reviews on Intuniv, NO WAY I will switch him to that, I'll pay the money and look for better insurance.  I highly recommend CapVay.

He had already been taking clonodine, so this was a nice long acting version that allowed me to give him much less Focalin (his other med).  However, after about two months, he developed a severe facial tick, pulling one side of his mouth back, had trouble focusing his eyes, and was pulling his eye back and blinking as well.  Fortunately, after taking him off of it, he is 98% better.  We were sorry we couldn't use it anymore, but be on the lookout for these symptoms.Read More Read Less  "

4554,Kapvay Oral,1/12/2012,25-34,Female,less than 1 month,Caregiver,,5.0,5,5,5,My son is 6 year old 1st grader and currently takes Vyvanse and Kapvay.  Kapvay is of course the more recent medication.  Vyvanse worked alright for awhile on it's own but he started talking way too much and was too wired to go to sleep.  I was constantly receiving notes from school about him beind disruptive and talking too much then of course bedtime was a battle.  Before kapvay we'd have to stay up with him until he was tired enough to sleep. If we put him to bed at his usual 8:30 he'd talk for like 2 hours straight.  As soon as we started Kapvay it was great.  It helped take the edge off and he started getting tired around bedtime FINALLY! No more staying up with my 6 year old.  And behavior has improved in school.  He currently takes 50mg of Vyvanse and 0.2mg daily (Kapvay twice daily 0.1mg in the morning and 0.1mg just after dinner). I was surprised at how quickly it started to work since it says it does not really work until 5 weeks of taking the meds.  He has only been taking Kapvay 3 weeks now but we saw changes in his sleeping at the end of the first week and behavior changes at school the 2nd week! Considering it's only been 3 weeks I can't wait to see how things will be at 5 weeks. Kapvay has definitely made me hopeful. And my son is much happier.  I would say the only side effect he's experiencing which I didn't even really realize until today is the dry mouth.  He's been drinking more water lately and he typically hates water.  So it's kind of a plus for us although we do keep an eye on him in case he starts overdoing it.Read More Read Less

4557,Kapvay Oral,3/31/2011,7-12,Male,1 to 6 months,Caregiver,Other,4.0,4,4,4,"My son developed a head tic after being on ADD medicine for 20 days. Kapvay has helped with the tic quite a bit although when he is over stimulated it still comes out in full force.  Currently, he is not on ADD meds anymore, just the Kapvay .3mg. In the beginning it did make him very tired and each time we dose-up it starts the tiredness over but after about 2 weeks he's almost back to normal. If you ask him, he would rather be a little tired than to have the head tic. I don't know that I would say it has helped with his focus or concentration but it has slowed him down which helps with his classroom behavior.Read More Read Less  "

Amlodipine just made my legs swell up as big as an elephant's and my hair fall out, but Edarbiclor, which I thought was going to work well on lowering my blood pressure, made me have an irreglar, very fast heartbeat and my blood pressure rise to 225/110 and I spent the night in the hospital where they finally got my blood pressure down and my diastolic reading was down to 35. They put me on Valsartan and I did very well on it... till they recalled it and now I can't find anything that really keeps it down.  I am on Hydralzine, 3 of them three times a day.

Be careful, as my bp fluctuated from 140/100 down to 70/60. Stabilized eventually. I later decreased to 40/12.5 as the diuretic was too strong and my bp was too often coming out low and I was dizzy when first standing. Even at the lower dose I sometimes am. Working on losing weight now to go back to Hyzaar as this stuff is more expensive ($100 for 3 months compared to $4 for 3 months of generic hyzaar). I also think in general I felt better when I was taking only hyzaar, so if I can lose weight I'd rather take it. Read More Read Less  "

I am 71 years, prognosis not good! I was prescribed Edarbyclor six months ago, my BP is now 135/90 with much improved creatinine and GFR readings. The only noticeable side effect for me has been slight constipation. which has been easy to deal with. Edarbyclor for me has been a magical fix for my hypertension. I can see fro many other comments on this post that it does not suit everyone. My experience with hypertension drugs over 25 years has been awful for side effects of so many prescribed drugs.

4673,Ziac Oral,4/18/2014,55-64,Male,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,High Blood Pressure,4.0,4,5,3,After trying several BP medications I was finally put Ziac because I have high BP and a high heart beat.  I have been on this medication for about 1 year now and the two of my side effects I have are:  feeling tired & dry mouth when I sleep.  The dry mouth wakes me up at least 6 to 10 times a night because it's hard to swallow.  I currently us over the counter sprays ect. with little to no results.  Because of these side effects I plan to ask my doctor this next week about other medication options but I'm worried about changing this particular pill because it has slowed my heart beat down which I believe has helped me a great deal.  Does anyone have any suggestions for options? Read More Read Less

I never really saw a substantial decrease in my bp at all during that time.  Also, about a year ago I started having diarrhea.  I had no other symptoms, such as stomach pain, bleeding, etc, just diarrhea 1-3 times a day.  I discussed it with my family doctor, who in turn sent me to a gastro specialist.  After several visits, an endoscopy and a colonoscopy he could not figure out what was causing the problem.  He then told me to stop taking the Ziac to see if that would help.  Well now it has been 8 days since I've taken it and not only have I not had any bouts of diarrhea (who knew you could get excited about a normal bowel movement!), but my bp is staying the same and I'm not getting up 2 times a night to use the bathroom.

First I went Brady with a pulse of 41 then it felt like someone was sitting on my chest followed by a rushing of blood to my head that felt like  mini-stroke.  It did however lower my BP but I cant function on this med it feels like its killing me with an adverse reaction possibly anaphylaxis. Side effects include all the above in the warnings def. discontinuing this one but now what is the question. Came of Lisinopril 40 mg HCTZ and Norvasc to try this and all that wasn't working for beans. Can stand the cough on Lisinopril and this was doing the same thing to me also but worse makes my throat close up literally.  Had to take Bendryl to stop it. Read More Read Less

Also weakness, fatigue, ED,and soon after started taking it my teeth started to fall out.  They would become very loose and eventually fall out or have to be pulled.  In a five year period all but 4 teeth had fallen out.  After I researched common and rare side effects of Coreg my heart doctor switched me to Metoprolol and immediately my congestion went away and the last of my teeth stopped falling out as well as the ED went away.  As far as I am concerned this drug has way too many common and rare side effects that it is absolutely scary and I know that the drug I'm on now is not quite as effective as Coreg for the heart problems but frankly I've never, ever had high blood pressure and all my live it has been about 120/70.

In week five to sixth week I'll cut the Bp meds to 10mgs per day and see how that goes, I think the supplements and quiting alcohol is enough to not need the bp Meds but time will tell...... If I may offer some advice ( talk to your doctor before taking these vitamins just to make sure there safe for you) , I think taking these Supplements in my opinion are a must, NAC, Tocotrienol, Vita D3 and especially the magnesium, I do not have any side effects while taking the Telmisartan by itself ( maybe a little at first) my sense of smell has gotten better, I sleep better as well as I feel a lot healthier.

I take 20 mg normally at night before bed and sometimes another 20 mg at breakfast if my BP is a little high, so 20-40 mg/day keeps my BP around 110/65 which is now normal.

I began shedding, thinning, and dry/brittle hair about 1 year into taking this medication. Dr kept telling me that it was not the medication and blamed it on my aging (41 years old) and possible hormones. That answer did not sit right with me as my feelings were strong about relating my hair loss to this medication. I demanded my Dr change my medication and he put me on Amlodipine which has made a world of difference.

In a matter of months. My hair, Now looks like a man's severe balding head.  You can see scalp in many places.  I'm so sad about this.   My eyebrows are also thinned and are on their way to bald.  

Why is this hair thinning and balding not tested and listed as a very common side effect.  Look at all the other reviews.  Most mention, thinning and balding!  

This is a dirty deed to say this side effect is rare.  Someone should sue over not listing a common side effect.  
The labels and warnings should show like this.

Common side effects included: Severe Hair Thinning,  Severe Hair Balding.  

Oh by the way my doctor also said Irbesartan does not cause hair loss.  He was so certain.  He is so terribly wrong and mistaken about this side effect.

Why would the doctor lie?  Or is the pharma company insuring these doctors are misinformed?
  
This is like, Purdue Pharma, the producer of OxyContin, has marketed the drug excessively without stressing its addictive nature.

He wouldn't, 2 months later, I can see I'm going to go almost bald.  I got my primary care to put me on Telmisartan instead, which needs prior authorization from Medicare.   After you quit a medication that gives you hair loss, it takes 3-6 months to START growing back, so as the hair you have left naturally falls out, nothing comes back for a WHILE.

Last June I noticed a skin rush but thought maybe it was something I ate. August 18th I was taken to ICU as I woke up with my lips, tongue, and jaw swollen and small rushes all over my body. Still, I did not connect it with Approvel as I have been taking it for a while. I was given cortisone with antihistamines and returned home. On and off body rushes every 2-3 days and on 26th Sept I told my doctor so he said to stop the BP medication as it could be a pill side effect. Today, 29 Sep 2017 I woke up at 5.30 in the morning with the exact the same reaction (swollen lips, tongue, rush). Was taken again to ICU and repeated the whole process. This time my blood pressure that was 14.3 over 11.5. Needless to say, I was really scared so as I did not take any other medication just the BP ones. Long story short!

Was at other Dr's a week prior twice and each time blood pressure was good- 130/72. I was prescribed 120 mg once daily to start to address both issues. I am overweight and out of shape but hey i had committed to my exercise regimen, only to be plagued with PVC's everytime...i kept exercising though. I noticed slight headache and tiredness soon after taking Cartia then noticed after 4 hrs it seemed to wear off. As far as my bp and PVC's, it did absolutely nothing- in fact, i seemed more on edge and the PVC's came on earlier than my usual 30 minutes into exercising. I had been doing cardio 5-6 times a week,for about 2 mos starting off at 30 mins/350 cal, built up to 55 min/900 cal. I only had these PVC's when exercising for prolonged time. had holter monitor echo/stress test, which were good, but the problem doesnt happen til 30 mins of continuous exercise and will continue as long as i continue to exercise. I took Cartia for a week. it didnt seem to help and i was getting pvc's MORE often. Like i said, no change in bp or Pvc's. Seems like its not at all extended release... exercised 2 hrs after taking it and still no difference in bp or pvc's.  i have a knee injury and stopped taking cartia and now no pvc's at all.

Aceon is better, but if I go below 77 I feel like a damp rag, so I have to monitor BP daily. Coughing is a minor side effect for me (once a day for 5 seconds--just keep water handy), but a friend of mine had to stop taking after 5 years because of the cough. She went onto Avapro. My cardiologist is happy with my BP which is in the low 130/85 or so most of the time. I have low libido, not sure if it is related. Aceon intensifies the effect of alcohol for me, I have to be careful. Otherwise in fine health.Read More Read Less  "

I stopped having sinus problems after being on this medication for awhile.  It keeps my blood pressure at 150 even when my sugar is low.  I believe the pills should not be split.  The 20 milligrams should be used more than the 40 milligrams, because it pushes your blood pressure down too low, the 40 milligrams. You stay  ahead of other diseases, like liver disease, because it aids the liver when you are a diabetic.

I have been on it for 4 months and now am experiencing joint pain in my hips which radiates to my knee, calf muscle stiffness,a rash on the outside of my armpits and itchy skin on my thighs.  I have been on many BP meds.  My Dr. said I have to over look the side effects.  My Bp is 122/64 most of the time. It is driving me crazy!  Everyone has different reactions  to this drug, but I am seeing a pattern through the reviews on Web MD.  I am glad I am not the only one with these problems.Read More Read Less  "

It has lowered my bp from approx. 145/90 to 125/80.  Not great but not bad.  I take 80/12.5.  But as some other reviewers have said, I've had many symptoms that I hadn't been attributing as side effects of this med, but may well be: nagging dry hacking cough (the worst symptom), sleep problems, lethargy, depression, weight gain, vision deterioration, sinus and nasal congestion, closed throat (when I get a cold, I can't breathe through my mouth when my nose is clogged up and I'm afraid I'll suffocate), hair thinning, diarrhea almost every morning.  And one big thing.  I had never had a problem with my kidneys in my life, and last year I developed an enormous kidney stone - the Urol. said it was the biggest he's ever seen.  So beware of anything with the kidneys. You should also know that there is now a so-called ""generic version"" of this: telmisartan-hydrochlorothiazide, but my side effects have gotten much worse in the two weeks I've been on it. I will have to get my doctor to change my medication, because now that it is available in generic, the insurance company probably won't let me go back to the name brand.  I hate the individual blister packs too.  Why can't they just put them in a bottle?Read More Read Less  "

It seems to maintain a steady BP for me. If I have any side effects it would be occasional dizziness, and occasional diarrhea. These are tolerable compared to others.

Its cheap and I like that I can split it in 2 if running low. Disclaimer:Im a blk man with hereditary BP so only weigh 145 but in stress BP gets to 150/100 or when I dont renew prescription and freestyle diet, I start to feel warning headaches and its 178/110 months later on extreme stress days. Just started reading about this and trying to wean myself off lisinop given the long term liver risk. Ironically if I hit the gym hard and watch my diet, I can drop to normal BP with NO meds but then am weighing about 130lbs and ppl look at me like.. due, are you sick, yet am healthiest then but the trade-off is almost a caveman diet and looking  wiry at 5'11. Im married already so it dont bother me and my sex drive is normal. Am just worried about long term and want to steer clear as much as possible till I may need it later when my frame cant keep up with the high impact cardio and gym routines.

My arthritis meds did not work with HCTZ. All though I was sleeping all night I was in pain from the Arthrutec not working on my arthritis. Then Lopressor.

I had heart palpitations, the least little thing I did, trying to clean a bathroom, was out of breath with heart pounding, felt jittery and last was the itchy rash on my thighs and back.  I went to the dermatologist who did a biopsy and it came back as contact dermatitis or an reaction to a medication.  I never knew a blood pressure medication could give you a rash until I started reading the user reviews on this and found I was not the only one. My doctor took me off this horrible stuff a few days ago and put me on something else.  The rash is still there but it cleared up on my back, but my legs are still bad. The palpitations and jittery feeling are now gone. The derm. said it could take several weeks to clear up and I am using an ointment for the itching and CeraVE itch relief cream which does help.

I bought a blood pressure monitor on a whim and readings were at Stage 2 hypertension. My doctor put me on 12.5mg of Clorthalidone and I felt much, much more alive than I have in a very long time. I don't know if there is a connection between this med and my depression, but it has done what other treatments, (increasing depression meds, more therapy has not done. I was so unhappy and frustrated that to be honest I considered suicide multiple times. I tried everything my therapist and psychiatrist suggested all to no avail.

I chugged half a gallon of OJ, drank Pickle juice, ate 3 bananas and drank 2 Gatorades. I still don't feel right! Thankfully I am going to my Dr tomorrow which is what kept me out of the ER.

I have been on Losartan 100mg for 4 years, with dietary adjustments, but my BP still averages 130/90.    My NP and I discussed complimenting Losartan with a daily 25mg dose of Chlorthalidone.    I was prepared with potassium water, supplements, and Propel. This would be added to my already daily gallon of water intake.    I took six doses of this medication. Four days in I began getting what I initially thought was a sinus headache, i.e. pressure on my face.     Over the next two days, this progressed to:  -Intense pressure pushing into and around my eyes.  -Trouble focusing my left eye  -Loss of appetite.  -Mild vertigo.  -Anxiety and flushes of dread.  -Numbness and tingling sensation over my face.  -Fatigue   -Muscle pain and cramping along the back of my    neck.    I contacted my NP, and was told to stop the medication.     After being off the medication for 3 days I was still dealing with the headache and episodes of mild vertigo mixed with anxiety. After 5 days off the medication I was having mild headaches and mild face pressure. I have read the full expulsion of the drug can take up to 120 hours. This is grueling.    I found out that over a week off the medication my potassium was at a 2.8 (low end of range is 3.5). It took me over 10 calendar days to get my body back in line after taking this medication.

I  Read all the reviews and almost didnâ??t take it . But I had also had abdominal surgery and was retaining fluid so my surgeon also thought it might help with that issue.  I Started by setting my alarm for an hour before I normally get up and kept it by my bed so I could take it and lay there for another hour just Incase .  I have not any issue with dizziness or being lightheaded.   After the second day I started seeing my legs , ankles and feet shrink and even my hands .  As an added benefit I have had less fluid building up at my surgery site also. I did add a potassium supplement to my daily vitamins .  And while I donâ??t drink a lot of extra fluid I make sure to get my 64 ounces a day in.  I also did not have any issues with having to go to the bathroom a lot .

After PCP's trying one drug to counteract another one and they were ready to give me a third med to counteract one that made me swell, I went to a cardiologist and asked for help with treating my meds even though I had no heart problems. I decided that if I didn't want racing heart beats, low beats or swelling from taking meds, that a cardiologist would be the only one with the best knowledge on what to prescribe. That was the turning point in getting a one pill treatment that works.  I take a 25mg. tablet once a day. This and a statin are the only meds that I need to take.

She had to have her meds increased as she gained weight but she hasn't had anymore problems with kidney failure, heart failure or black outs since. These are problems yoou can ahve with her type.

Most of my doctors over the years have tried to get me to take something else but I have no side effects and it works so I am not about to change. Because of change in insurance, I had to go to a generic.  Be careful, they are not all the same.  I believe there are 3 generics for this.  I tried one and it did not work at all.  The druggist said it could be the delivery system.  I now take a yellow pill called propranolol 80mg ERCAP AC.  It is one of the generics for Inderal LA.  I like to take only one pill a day.  I once was on a higher dose for a short time but it caused me problems.  When I lost a lot of weight, I was able to go off of the drug totally, but do it gradually.  The doctor took me off cold and I had bad reactions but they did go away.  In the last 5 years HCTZ 12.5 M has been added and recently that has been removed but I think I may start again since a noticed a small increase in BP.  Hope this helps.Read More Read Less  "

My pulse dropped to 50-60 bpm and I could not get it very high when exercising. I swim for 2-3 hours per week. I walk a lot and don't sit down much even in the evenings because I have no TV. The side effects I noticed were:  Hair loss by the handful  Weight gain  Abnormal thirst  Tiredness after activity  Agitation of mind  Sleeplessness  My doctor saw me again and said my BP was higher and put me on 50mgs od.   My brain seemed to scramble, I could not concentrate or sleep for repetitive music or worries going round in my head  I started to feel arrhythmias when I exercised and when I lay down to sleep.  My BP went HIGHER  My doctor said that BP was rarely controlled by one drug alone.  I am a very active person, I walked 27 miles in 9 hours, not bad for a veteran, especially over stony challenging moorland.   It has seemed to me the low pulse restricted my heart to the point my body had no option but to pump harder and enlarge my heart.   I have stopped the Tenormin and take Co enzyme Q10 and my BP has returned to normal and the side effects have disappeared.  I have 1mg (one milligram) of Diazepam to take if I feel very stressed and that seems to be both occasional and effective.     Read More Read Less  "

Side effects that I experienced were Nasal Congestion, trouble thinking and concentration, dizziness, balance problems, lightheadedness, slow heart rate (38-40), trouble breathing, cough, dry mouth, wheezing, numbness in feet and hands, slurred speech, stuffy or runny nose and blurred vision. I stopped taking Carvidolol 6 days ago and my heart rate has not gone below 60 bpm since then. I do not have high blood pressure. Waiting to talk to my cardiologist about this.

Hush, hush.  The Insurance and Pharma Industry don't want to hear this, or that the Government hear such a complaint.  When someone feels that they have side effects, etc. they think is their body.  They should be aware that, often, is probably not them. It is the Ineffective generic pill that is not producing the intended medicinal effect, because POOR Manufacturing.  When this happens, go and buy a few Brand Name Coreg pill and you will see the difference. Why I know? Because years back I landed a couple of time in the Hospital with Severe Arrythmia. When they gave me a Brand Name pill I felt better within hours. Since then, I have brand Name Coreg. When I start feeling Arrythmia takin the pills from the generic bottle I am using, I start taking Brand name that I always have saved at home. If they are not too old, done, they solve the problem and I start feeling better within hours.  Then I have to go for a new Generic bottle approved by my insurance, which generally works good until the problem arises again after a few months later.  Generally, the next bottle is normally good.  It is all due to imperfect mixture of ingredients that occasionally happen, due to poor manufacturing and well known lack or US Regulations for Generic Drugs.              Read More Read Less  "

After I switched from 6.25mg to 12.5mg, I started having HEART PALPITATIONS. Mild at first but increased overtime to a POUNDING, IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT which combined the STOMACH ISSUSES, DIZZINESS and BREATHING PROBLEMS sent me straight to the EMERGENCY ROOM! They did an EKG and bloodwork and found nothing life threatening so they sent me home.

My worthless cardiologist's solution to the problem was to increase the dosage to 18.75mg. Within a couple of weeks I was back in the ER twice with all of the warning signs of a HEART ATTACK! CHEST DISCOMFORT, IRREGULAR/ SKIPPING HEARTBEAT, NAUSEA, WEAKNESS DIZZINESS and being UNABLE TO CATCH MY BREATH.

5516,Amlodipine Oral,10/26/2023,55-64,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,High Blood Pressure,1.7,1,3,1,"While hospitalized for a broken hip and semi-hip replacement surgery the general medicine doctor responsible for my care thought my 10 MG 2X a day lisinopril medicine was not controlling my blood pressure well enough. He increased lisinopril to 40 MG once a day and added the drug AMLODIPINE 5 mg 1X a ady.Within 2 days I was experiencing uncontrolled movements head and body twisted, turned from side to side, arms bent flailing around, hands clenching and unclenching, arms and hands twitching, back and shoulder muscles tightening and twitching. I also started showing symptoms of manic behavior. Racing thoughts, I felt like my mind was racing 1000 mph, faster than normal nonstop talking, no appetite, excessive energy (a great feeling when you are confined to bed after hip replacement surgery).Due to nursing staff shortage on floor and physical therapy being short staffed also, even when I could have been mobile with a walker no one had time to spot me (walk along side of me) to prevent falling. I  was not sleeping at all not eating much of anything so sometimes I felt light headed and weak. All of this after breaking a hip and finding out that the fracture occurred because I have metastatic breast cancer of the bone. Those 2 health conditions made eating healthy and well, plus getting good sleep and rest very important  for my well-being. Lack of sleep alone for days can lead to hallucinations and psychotic episodes.  The doctor who prescribed amlodipine besylate for me knew I also suffered from Parkinson disease. Diagnosed in fall of 2013 and taking medicine that  controlled all symptoms (the main symptom of my Parkinson disease is tremors in my left hand and arm with a little shortening of my gait). Although I have been diagnosed for 10 years I have experienced little progression of symptoms and no change in medication or increase in dosage in 4 years.
Yet the doctor at the hospital blamed all of the uncontrolled movements along with all the manic behavior  on my Parkinson . The hospital doctors were very concerned that all the twisting, turning and bending of my torso could dislocated my new hip replacement since the movements were uncontrolled and there were certain positions I was not allowed to do like get closer to my hip than 90° or sitting upright in a chair, could not allow my leg or foot to turn inward both of which could occur with the contorted movements my torso was making. The doctor decided that he would recommend giving me an entire extra dose of my Parkinson meds between normal doses. It may have lessened severity of movements for 1-2 hours but they came back stronger. Which led to more Parkinson meds. I left hospital after about 9 or 10 days as they were trying to discover what type of metastatic cancer I had. I was sent to inpatient rehab for  physical and occupational therapy to learn how to do certain things and strengthen muscles to protect my bones weakened by cancer and get stronger to undergo cancer treatments.  AND THE WEIRD MOVEMENTS AND MANIC BEHAVIOR just increased. I  asked every doctor, nurse, I came in contact with even reached out to my neurologist office  to help me figure out what was causing this and to stop it. After 6 weeks I got to come home, I had been looking into all the drugs I was taking at the time checking every resource for side effects and possible drug interactions. I found 1 drug that did list many of my symptoms as rare side effects  but both doctor and pharmacist agreed not likely the cause since I had been on this drug since 2013. My sister and I were discussing it on night. She said think when you first got these weird symptoms when was it and what changed around that time. I said the doctor increased my lisinopril dose and started giving me AMLODIPINE. my sister agreed that she thought it started then too. She said at Doctors appointment next day to tell doctor this again and suggest you go back to taking only medication I was taking before symptoms except to keep 40 MG lisiRead More Read Less  "

I started the blood pressure med amlodipine, 5 mg because I had hypertension and I had side effects immediately they have lasted for three years straight. The first side effect was a hard time breathing the list is so long, wheezing daily, tinnitus, made my Tourette’s worse, swollen tongue every day numb face, numb tongue, lips swollen and numb, eye site issues felt like somebody was stabbing me in my eyeballs , stroke like symptoms daily, my tongue turned white (48 hours off med today pink tongue is back) ear pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, extreme tiredness and heart beat crazy,nerve pain, severe hot flushing of the skin, severe stabbing random pains all over my body, brain fog where I could barely remember anything, slow like a sloth, static electricity in my brain, when I stood up, heavy arms and legs neuropathy in feet,dizziness, severe lightheaded, could barely function,severe stomach pain, severe back pain and kidney pain,severe fatigue,depression and made me cry, headaches severe itching all over my body, sometimes with hives or without hives, severe itching of the vulva (LS)and perinium area which was diagnosed by biopsy, it ate my gums away to were My nerves in my teeth are showing,swollen gums so I’m possibly losing all my teeth now, severe dry mouth eyes and nose like the Sahara desert and severe nausea,insomnia, severe anxiety and panic attacks.Shaking and severe high blood sugars 350-560 daily after taking it.  I have tingling and all my nerves throughout my body.  I feel like I’m in fight or flight and fighting for my life every time I take it. It makes my blood pressure go so severely. High I can barely stand. It has never lowered my blood pressure not at all. I think it causes gout. I have severe pain in my bones and my muscles, and it feels like my ligaments are rubber bands, and in so much pain. Severe muscle twitching, and my muscles, feel like they have wasted away in my body. It’s still causes a hard time breathing like I’m running a race  just being upright walking. It causes sinus issues to were It feels like my nose is closing up and my throat. One thing I can mention as I had a biopsy done on my vulva area and I was diagnosed with Linchin sclerosis and the second biopsy right next to it said, allergic reaction to oral medication. So cardiologist said quit the medication back in February but I stayed on it because it did help my palpitations at first it made me have weird, crazy palpitations in the middle of nowhere huge palpitations and severe chest pain but then it made my palpitations better 2nd year. so I started sweating so severely and I couldn’t function, and I felt like I wasn’t going to make it much longer. so I went to the store and I felt like I was going to pass out constantly on the medication that was one big issue and it wasn’t because of low blood pressure. My blood pressure was severely high when this was happening and I just decided to finally quit it. I am over two days off amlodipine already and already 70% of the side effects are gone . Tomorrow at 12:30 PM will be three full days off of the medication. There is way more side effects but I figured there’s no more room to write it here.

In the meantime, our family doctors and clinic were complaining that we had not been in for too long (if it isn't broke don't fix it ... is our thought), so we had to go get back to seeing them! Well, the doc we had been seeing was gone, so we were given another one. And she thought i should run a lower BP reading, so she put me on SPIRO. I am 79 and my previous cardiologist was okay with my numbers. Anyway after 26 days on SPIRO 25 mg 1 per day I have: lower leg cramps at night, waking up after 3/4 hours of sleep, constant left shoulder pain, runny nose and stuffy head,mucusy throat, more urinating,fatigue,dry hard stool!none of my daily habits have changed except for taking SPIRO, which I stopped this morning     Read More Read Less  "

Small puppy acne along with the hormonal acne on the jaw line that seems to pop up a new pimple daily. It did relieve most of my cystic acne, but still continued to get three pimples a week. 
This medication caused me to lose my appetite, so much so that I had dropped a dangerous amount of weight. I’m 5’ 4” and had weighed 150lbs. After starting spiro, I dropped to 103lbs. I fainted many times and looked absolutely starved. This has also caused a lot of stomach pain for me while trying to gain weight back, I’m nervous to even find out what it’s done to my gut. 
Kidney stones do NOT run in my family. Yet, suddenly, I’ve had 6 bladder infections and 4 rounds of kidney stones. They claim it is easy on kidneys, but not if you are at a healthy weight!!!! I was parched no matter how much water I drank (195oz of water some days) and can’t stop peeing. You will have to pee every fifteen minutes and it will not even be a complete pee. 
Spiro also had a significant impact on my sanity. I lost my self confidence, depression ruled my life (no joke, the brink of suicide), anxiety so bad it caused me to self isolate and abandon everybody I had. This medication may not be for you. Nothing is worth dangerous weight loss, fainting, kidney stones, infections, or poor mental health. 
Best part is the doctors will just keep prescribing it and recommend you to a kidney specialist for stones and infections & a psychiatrist who will try putting you on antipsychotics. 
Taking one medication would have lead me to taking 5 EXTRAS because the doctors will not admit it was the spiro. Funny how none of those issues are a part of my life now that I stopped, besides my acne is back in full force. Don’t fall for the bandaid method, guys. I’m not sure how to get to the root cause, they will never help us actually balance our hormones. So acne it is…Read More Read Less  "

It blocks testosterone… a hormone you need for muscle mass. I eat very clean, workout and have weighed pretty much the same my entire life. I gained 5 lbs in 5 months, which doesn’t sound like much but freaked me out enough to take myself off it. Now off 8 months, I continue to gain and am now up to a 10 lbs gain. For the first time ever I have a belly and have developed a layer of fat on my hips. It will not budge, even on a pretty significant calorie deficit diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. No alcohol, sweets, sugary drinks or fast food. There is nothing more I can give up yet not only do I not lose, I continue to gradually gain. All of my doctors poo-poo my concerns saying 10 lbs. is not much, and my BMI is still good, but at this rate it will turn to 20 lbs., then 30 lbs. and I will be obese. This med “feminizes” the body, making it softer, rounder and flabby. When your muscle mass decreases so does your metabolism, slows your digestion and your ability to process estrogen so it continues to take over the balance of testosterone and progesterone. Isn’t that basic Bio 101?! If you are a woman and your doc prescribes this, RUN.Read More Read Less  "

I will say it did take MONTHS for everything to clear but after those first few months I get not a single blemish or breakout EVER. I see a lot of articles online about spironolactone and how long it takes to become effective and I would just like to say as long as it takes to work - it is 100% worth it and you can take it long term with no problem. I started taking it at maybe age 21 when I first experienced severe cystic acne, tried coming off it as a few years passed and alllllll the acne came back and was even worse because I also came off BC. I am back on BC, spiro, and use tretinoin and now strangers compliment my skin!! So bottom line is it's worth the wait and don't get antsy once it works and try coming off of it. My only thing is I can get lightheaded when I strenuously exercise especially if I don't eat something beforehand. That's it. Give it a try if you have severe or even moderate acne.

Here is the thing, I was really REALLY worried about giving this med a chance.   Frankly nothing was breaking thru my high numbers. Trial and all error for years now. As some of you know, that gets old. It gets really old.

For me this med is well tolerated. I take it in the morning.. So far no side-effects. I have been taking this for a few months. --

After a few years of doctors trying different combinations of blood pressure meds, an endocrinologist diagnosed the hyperaldosteronism. I initially began taking Spironolactone to treat but after a few weeks I began experiencing breast pain and noting breast enlargement (Gynocomastia). My doctor switched me to Eplerenone which is supposed to equally effective, but without that particular side effect. The breast issue went away and my potassium levels have stabilized into a normal range. My BP continues to be marginally high at times, but I think other factors will need to be improved (like my weight) to get over the hump. Overall, I am pleased to date, but another users previous review about kidney disease after 5 years of this medication have me greatly concerned.

After a routine dr visit last week my doc prescribed me Losartan 100mg going forward.  However, just this week while still on Losartan 50mg I have seen my blood pressures (taken twice daily) drop and stay steady at low 120s over high 70s.  The only variables worth noting are that I also started taking Lipitor 20mg about 30 days ago.  Beyond that, it may seem like Losartan simply took longer to take effect with my body than the stated average (up to 3-6 weeks according to most documentation).  I haven't noticed any notable side effects as of yet, and was really disappointed in the lack of effectiveness of 50mg up until now - but I'm happy with the recently lower BP levels.  I would have never thought it would take 4 months for a medicine to kick in but it's worth it if my levels stay where they are at now (and I can stay at 50mg or possibly even reduce Losartan altogether at some point.)

I think my cuff reads high. Went to the Dr (NP) mid last year and noticed that the 'bar' for normal was lowered for 60+ year olds (to 120/80). I have read that bp rises with age but the NP insisted I go on a higher dose. My office bp was very high even though I doubled up on the pills that day before I went in. I was so mad arguing with the NP. When I got home, my bp was low (duh). I had continued taking the med until the prescription ran out - I did not go back to the office. Now, I am off cold turkey and I think I have withdrawal symptoms from it. I cannot find what the withdrawal symptoms are for this drug, but it doesn't feel good at all.Read More Read Less  "

I got horrible side effects, stuffy nose, dizzy, sleepy, joint pain, nervous, raised pulse, poor sleep.

5752,Losartan Oral,2/12/2024,45-54,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,High Blood Pressure,1.0,1,1,1,"In a way taking this medication was the worst decision of my life but also may be the best...

Dr. noticed high BP. He was quick to prescribe a medication and not recommend any life style changes. He prescribes 100mg. I do my research before taking it and I'm naturally skeptic so I split twice and take 25 MG instead. 

First couple days I did feel good. First three weeks went by fine, I actually didn't measure BP because I could feel it working. The fourth week was where I starting to get lightheaded. Then came the nausea, bloated ness, immense waves of anxiety that actually rose my BP. This was after taking a dose mind you. I couldn't eat, sleep, or workout. How is this supposed to make me healthy? This wasn't life. 

Everything I felt was confirmed here and elsewhere. 

The good thing is that it scared me into doing a 180 in my lifestyle. Diet, supplements, and workouts(although I get out of breath sometimes). 

I've lost about 8 lbs already. I'm 5 days off and I do have some withdrawal symptoms which are mainly anxiety but that is nothing to how terrible I felt while on it. I have a checkup in two months and I claim to come back with exemplary numbers. 

Make lifestyle changes. If you do have to take it still make those changes.

But be very very careful with this poison. Read More Read Less  "
5753,Losartan Oral,1/18/2024,45-54,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,High Blood Pressure,2.0,2,2,2,I’ve always felt ok but was put on 12.5 mg because of slightly high blood pressure Been on this medication for 5 days I feel bad anxiety insomnia and depression and feel like I’m losing my grip on things I’ve never felt worse
5754,Losartan Oral,1/14/2024,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,High Blood Pressure,1.0,1,1,1,"I’m a 33 year old healthy male who has high blood pressure due to genetics. My heart is healthy and so is all my other organs and all my levels are perfect. I eat right and I’m a trained kickboxer so I am very active. 

I say all that to paint the picture of my experience. 
I was put on a beta blocker in 2020 (carvedilol) started on small does and moved up to now I take 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night. 

I went to the ER because my bp was high and I couldn’t get it down (170/106). The DR at the ER prescribed this to me(not my dr) because he said he takes losartan and said it helps him. He prescribed 50mg and told me if it drops my bp too log to take half(25mg). I don’t blame him because he was trying to be helpful because I can’t see my Dr for 2 weeks. 

I took it for 4 days and ended up in the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. 
My heart was pounding, I was so dizzy, my heart rate would jump from 80 to 125 instantly when going from laying down to standing. My chest hurt so bad and the headaches were bad. 

My blood pressure was normal though. 

When I went back to the er i decided to go to a different hospital, one that specializes in hearts and the dr in the er wasn’t surprised with my symptoms and knew right away about this medication. He assured me I was fine and all my labs and test (ekg and blood work) confirmed I was fine. That was last night when I went.

Didn’t take losartan today and I feel better, but still have slight headache and some palpitations, also my legs are weak and hurts to walk. My legs are extremely fit so this is really unusual for me. 
I hope this is just the meds leaving my body and not a long term damage. 

I know this is a long post but I wanted to give a full picture in hopes it will help someone else who fits this description and know they aren’t alone. 

My suggestion it talk to your Dr asap if you feel you are getting worse and if you get into your Dr go to ER. Don’t risk it because this medication is dangerous to some people, I’m definitely one of those people. Read More Read Less  "

I have never been ""on"" anything besides daily multi-vitamins, Claritin, or birth control in my younger days. I'm 35 (today) and just had my 2nd child on 8-29. My doctor prescribed this because I am breastfeeding and it is supposed to be the safest for the baby. My blood pressure was always pretty regular (135/70 to 145/80) but after I delivered, it was creeping up to 150/90's. My doctor put me on 1000mg a day (500 morning & night). Besides being up every 2 hours to feed my daughter (which could account for me being extremely tired), I am getting some bad headaches, which I think is the meds. Any idea when these may go away?

I developed HBP early on the pregnancy, so my doctor put me on Aldomet because he said it was the safest bpm out there. I had a great pregnancy and labor, and that was the only med I was taking. Now I am 49 and my son is 15 and Moderately Autistic despite having a full term plus pregnancy. I dont know what causes AU, but for those of you that are pregnant and this is subscribe, be forewarned. My first son, I developed toxemia during the last trimester, and I was put on partial bed rest but no meds, and he is fine. Just something to think about. Many Moms take this med and have no issues later, and as  my doc. told me he did not want me to be on any prescribed meds, but due to my HBP. and if I wanted to continue the pregnacy, this was the best choice. I took the smallest amount , I think it was either 5-10 mg 1x a day....you just never know, be aware and ask lots of questions.... to your doc, they sure are getting paid for it, If I had to do it over again, I would have told him to take me out of work and put me on bedrest, Ilove my son dearly and this may not be the reason he is AU, but I cant dismiss it....this Autism is a bitch is the easiet sense of the word, and world....Read More Read Less  "

Not knowing my status with more children my dr kept on my it.  In Dec 2008, I had a severe joint pain, unable to walk up stairs and blisters on my hands.  I had two more 'flare ups' in Apr 2009 and July 2009 before being sent to a Rheumotologist and getting diagnosed with Drug-Induced Lupus.  Within 3 weeks of changing to Benicar, I stopped feeling like I was 90 years old.  Which was good ( I was in my late 30's).  Now I feel like I am in my 60's and the same Rheumotologist diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia.   I am wondering if Aldomet set that off as well.  Benicar controls my blood pressure much better.

No-one picked it up for 8 years until I found a great PM anaesthetist. He found 3 levels of crushed spinal nerves after 8 years of being misdiagnosed.Nerve ablation worked really well for me. I always knew it was physical pain Thought I would get better but just got worse. A friend of mine who is a med specialist couldn't believe the pain I was in. Advised me to see an anaesthetist. Wish I had found him first after 8 years of 24/7 pain. Have come down really fast from 80mgs 40mgs 80mgs oxycontin. Am now at 40mgs 40mgs 40mgs in less than one month. Makes my eyes dry and can't speak if I'm not chewing sugarless lollies or drinking water. Wake up every night round 2.30 to 3am take two, go back to sleep. Didn't realise they are addictive so will try one tonight. Never drive if I take one during a rough day. Makes me too tired. Didn't realise they cut down smoking. But at least can go hours without a smoke if I want to. My mum isn't well and have been able to help her instead of being locked in an addiction centre. My eyesight is crap though but don't think it was this med. Had to buy eyedrops and carry water everywhere. I probably feel a bit sick 'cause I still smoke. Wish my GP had told me they could help me quit smoking. Time for laser eye surgery again.Read More Read Less  "

Anyway every blood pressure medication made me terribly sick but I was always ready to try the next one, the one that always operated by a different mechanism. Finally, after a trail of failures, it was time for Lamotrigine. Frankly, it has changed my life entirely. At first I was just happy a week had passed without my throwing the pills away, feeling like I was going to die. I also suffered not a single side effect except some fatigue as my body adjusted to a non lethal blood pressure. In fact, my blood pressure dropped immediately to,a pretty normal range and has remained there. Along with with such a dramatic change in pressure I now have much more energy and now experience a sense of calmness rather than the constant anxiety 'for nothing' I had been living with for years.

It was awful relying on these medications due to all the side effects, but they did control my pain. One day recently, I got sick of taking them. I asked my physician if I could taper off and he did so to prevent withdrawal. At my last visit, he suggested Clonidine to assist with controlling my migraines and possibly reduce my pain level. I started out on .1 BID and now take .2 TID. It is working pretty well. I have no opiate withdrawal, notable pain relief (not all, but noticeable) and I haven't had one migraine headache. The headaches were likely caused by the car wrecks and they were awful. Clonidine takes awhile to get used to. My only bad side effect is insomnia sometimes that may last for a few days, then I'll sleep normally. Clonidine assists with my pain, prevents opiate withdrawal and my migraine headaches.Read More Read Less  "

After trying 9 medications with side effects to severe for me to handle, I was prescribed clonidine. I started out with one 0.1 mg per day which was then increased to 2 pills per day (0.1 mg) and am now taking 3 pills per day (0.1 mg).  This new dosage is working well but I hate to be on this medication after reading that it can cause glaucoma.  The problem for me is that I'm one of those patients who is allergic to many medications and clonidine is the only one I can handle.  My side effects are dry mouth and chest discomfort with pain down my left arm from time to time but compared to the severe migraines, diarrhea and dizziness while on 9 other BP meds, this one is fantastic.  I would just caution people to research the glaucoma side effect.  Glaucoma leads to blindness.  Is there anyone out there who has found a similar anti-hypertensive high BP medicine with fewer side effects?  Most high BP meds have terrible side effects including eventual kidney damage and diabetes.  Surely there must be something safer out there for us to use!!  Read More Read Less  "

I was able to locate a second generic version from Mylan Pharmaceuticals.  You may need to deal with a local NON-Chain pharmacy to secure this brand but it is well worth the effort.  This product is very flexible and adheres well for the full 7 days.  It is also comparable in size to the brand name product rather than the oversized PAR version.

I was supposed to continue taking the pills for 2-3 days because it can take that long for the patch to work. I damn near died. Had terrible withdrawals and thought it was side effects from another new rx. My bp monitor wouldn’t even read my bp. I saw 295 then it stopped. Did some research to find out I needed to be taking the pills. Took a pill and it took 2 doses before my bp came down to 194/98!!!

When I switched to the Catapres Clonidine Transdermal Patch around my high school years, I chose to because I had issues remembering how many pills I had to take and what times of the day I already took and would need to take them, and the patch offered me the option of only having to slap one on every week and that's it, no pills to keep track of or anything. I still keep the pills just in case I need an extra dose because my patch's effectiveness is dwindling towards the end of the week, but overall, the patch itself is not only handy and useful in both my remembering to take my medication, but it's also helped me significantly with being able to control and overcome my excessive movements, twitches, and tics, even though I'm not always able to completely stop them from occurring all the time. My only issue with this patch is how irritated it makes the parts of my chest where I keep it (which is inside near the upper portion of my bra - safer, less likely to fall off than if it were on my arm or elsewhere). The glue rubs off after a couple days of usage, and that might be because I take it off to shower or just because it wears off. And the glue does make the skin itchy, which I thought was partly due to my sensitive skin I have anyway even though the packaging states skin irritation may occur. Honestly, though? Even despite any side-effects I may have had growing up with this medication, I'm glad to have it, because it makes dealing with my condition so very much easier than if I never had it in the first place. Without it, it's difficult to function and stop twitching, so heed the warnings about not immediately stopping your dosage on it. If you need to stop, wean yourself off slowly at your doctor's advice!Read More Read Less  "

Sometimes my BP soared to 200 / 104    This medication seems to have reduced my BP by at least thirty to fifty points and somehow it has made me feel better than I have in years. I am taking 50mg mornings.    My US doctors had treated me for years for high blood pressure and then atrial fibrillation, without mentioning this type of medication. After eight months MINUS the medications recommended for high BP and AFib I have now come to a conclusion that at least in my case controlling BP is key to avoiding incidents of AFib. I live in Mexico now and put myself on this diuretic. What the hell is wrong with our medical community?Read More Read Less  "

I've been taking it for 1-1/2 mths and my body's still not adjusting to the electrolyte balancing aspect of the drug. Diuril has brought my blood pressure down by 30 points but still not to where it needs to be. And quite frankly, I'm not excited at the prospect of an increased dose because of the other issues.  I think the MD's should be more thorough with the patients before prescribing a diuretic 'waterpill' to treat high blood pressure. It would sure save us a lot of pain and suffering.

I find that, as long as I take it on schedule, and don't forget doses, my urine stream has improved a great deal, almost to the level of what I considered normal.    Oddly enough, though, I think this has led to another problem.  I've developed nocturia and often have to get up from bed to urinate.

It made breathing at night very difficult and getting out of bed in the morning very painful. Sexually my erections were very limp, hard to maintain and my drive was greatly diminished.  Even Viagra was less effective while taking Hytrin.  One strange side effect for me was a very noticeable change in the relaxed state of my scrotum and penis.

I could feel my heart beating in my throat and thought I was going to vomit all over. So now I am off Cymbalta after terrible withdrawals (use Omega 3-makes it alot easier) and I am trying this for my anxiety. I cant really tell what the outcome is yet.

My resting heart rate is over 110 without any meds.  I have tried many beta blockers and Betaxolol is by far the best of the best.  Resting heart rate is now lo 60's!!! Feel great.  Not many doctors prescribe this beta blocker because they don't know about it.  It was not marketed very well.  Almost all doctors prescribe Atenolol which did not work nearly as well for me.  Betaxolol has a much longer half life, so its effects remain rock solid stable throughout the entire day.  Another thing I like is that the circulation in my extremities is back to normal (warm feet and hands).  On other beta blockers I was almost to the point of thinking I had Reynauds syndrome.  My feet were ice cold and turning white.  I also take a small dose (1mg) of Doxazosin to further increase my circulation.  I wish many more people could find out about Betaxolol.

5964,Kerlone Oral,1/22/2009,45-54,Male,,Patient,High Blood Pressure,5.0,5,5,5,"One of the best beta blockers with the least side effects. It is great for blood pressure and heart rate control. This is a true beta-blocker with the relaxing and anti-anxiety qualities of PROPRANOL and the exact profile of Metoprolol/TOPROL, but without some of the side effects. One of the problems with this medication is the recent recall of the generic KERLONE known as BETAXOLOL. The medication was unavailable for a long time and this made many switch to another medication/beta blocker. Luckily KERLONE is avaliable once again. After the recall I would probably want to avoid the generic BETAXOLOL.Then again it may have improved after the FDA recall and publicity. For all HBP beta blocker users with side effects it's definitely worth giving KERLONE a try. You don't have much to lose. Read More Read Less  "

I was on a bp medication prior to this one and I stopped it pretty soon after beginning it. I read the reviews about it and it was a blood pressure medication that hadn't been used for many years. I can't remember the name of it, though it had been the reason for a few deaths I'd read about. I was on it like 3 months and started feeling like my body was dying. Sure glad I did read the reviews early on that one. Back to the Lisinopril and the reason I first started taking it. I was falsely accused of a crime and in a corrupt court system. My nerves were shot and I was weighing around 250 pounds. I had battled COVID - 19 and barely survived. I had called a EMS out to our house and the top number was like 209. The EMS workers tried to get me to go to the Hospital and I refused. By the time I was able to go to the doctor I had lost down to 235 pounds. The doctor prescribed me the 20 mg Lisinopril and it was probably a good thing at that time for me. I kept losing weight until I was at 218 pounds and then the weight leveled out at 225 pounds. I tried to get a lot of different doctors offices to put me on a blood pressure medication for around 12 to 15 years, before I was prescribed any blood pressure medication. If I can make it that long at the age I was already at, then I'll be fine without any of the bad meds for me now!Read More Read Less  "

My bp has always run low, top number is frequently under 100, bottom number is sometimes high 50's.  I also already had kidney disease so I questioned why the pcp would prescribe this.  After beginning the lisinoprilp I gained 25 lbs.  I developed a cough.  It wasn't a dry cough.  I developed wheezing.  I was prescribed additional medicine for gerd because the new wheezing and extra mucous, that I coughed up 15 or more times a day, was blamed on gerd.  My blood oxygen levels started dipping into the high 70's when I walked for even very short distances.  I had extreme fatigue and honestly felt like I was dying.  When I questioned my pcp she ignored me.  I kept questioning and she became defensive.  I found a new pcp, had lung function tests done, was put on oxygen and stopped taking the lisinopril.  Within a months time of discontinuing lisinopril I noticed a huge improvement.  I stopped coughing up mucous all day, stopped wheezing, was able to discontinue the oxygen, and was able to walk for longer distances without my oxygen dipping so low that I felt like I would pass out.  The only reason I can see for doctors to continue to prescribe lisinopril is some kind of incentives from the pharmaceutical companies.  I hope this info helps other people.  I wish I had never been prescribed lisinopril.  It robbed me of a year that I could have enjoyed with my family.  I couldn't even leave my house most days.Read More Read Less  "

Rushed down and the first thing the doc asked was if I was on blood pressure meds. I said yes, Lisinopril. He knew right away that was the problem. 

The observed me for 6 hours and sent me home and said ""no more lisinopril"". They put me on Amlodipine. SCARY stuff as it could have been much worse. It can lead to death if my tongue and throat closed up. I got lucky I guess.

I’ve had an intermittent stomach issue that presents like food poisoning. Started around the time I was prescribed Lisinopril. After eating, and normally in the evening, stomach pains starts with a dull ache and slowly grows to be unbearable. The only way to relive the pain is to force myself to vomit. During these episodes I feel faint, get the chills/sweats and cannot have a bowel movement. 

Had my gallbladder removed and multiple scopes, CTs with contrast, MRIs. Surgeon said it was acid reflux and prescribed PPI. Was heading down the path of a food intolerances but diet had no affect. 

Nobody ever questioned my only medication. 

I’ve been off the med for 6 weeks and I feel great. Blood pressure is normalizing, 130/88 and no stomach pain.

Dr kept having to up the dosage and my BP kept going up slowly. On 30mg I became sick and lethargic, upset stomach, nausea, diarhea. Saw many specialists and had procedures like endoscopy. Inflamation found in stomach and bowels. Not one single DR over the years mentioned maybe the Lisinopril was the problem. I have had this cough for several years, which really got bad once I was on 30 mg. Went to the dr a couple weeks ago, again lisinopril never questioned. Wanted to send me out for tests again. Finally I reviewed my meds and became suspicious about Lisinopril. Back to the dr and requested a change to Altace, another Ace Inh. In just one day my condition improved immensely, and my mental clarity as well. The cough is way better. My lungs felt like they were congested for a long time now, reminding me of when I used to smoke 30 years go. When I stopped the lisinopril my chest loosened up anf got flemmy, and I could cough up the build up caused by Lisinopril. Currently  on 5 mg of altace now for 1 week. MY BP at dr office was 164/85 the day I requested the altace (used to take altace til Blue Cross said they would not cover it and forced me to change meds). One week later my BP is 115/68 on 5 mg altace. I have an Omron BP machine at home. I am planning on trying some garlic as a remedy, and getting off ace inh all together.

I gained 40 lbs despite aggressive workouts and diet, depressed, could not concentrate, no libido. My research indicated that the Lopressor was likely culprit. Dr. Cardio basically said ""too bad, you have to take this for life or you will have another heart attack."" I decided to stop the med anyway and fired the Cardiologist office.  I asked Dr. GP to take over cardio care. He said yes, agreed with me stopping this med, and wants to get me off or lower the others from Dr. Cardio over the next year. 

That was 3 weeks ago. Lost 14 lbs so far, am running and lifting longer and harder without this poison. Mental fog and depression are gone, libido is back, sleeping much better. BP has dropped 20 points and RHR is down on average. This medication is known to have a negative effect on triglyceride, LDL, and HDL levels. I am curious as to lab results next month. 

This is my experience only. I am not saying to do what I did, but don't be afraid to DO YOUR RESEARCH and GET A SECOND OPINION if you don't believe the benefits are outweighing the side effects.

I do notice that I am lower on energy, but over all I feel fine. It has reduced my anxiety and I do occassionally experience vertigo if I am up to 6 hours late taking it.    I also experienced vertigo often with the buildup. I do have a dry cough that is not bothersome, and gets more intense if I forget to take it.

I was so impressed by his care into my well being, I wanted to become one of his patients but unfortunately, he could not take on new patients. Dr. Q never checked me out at all, relied on the doctor notes of a former physician or those physicians that I saw at the hospital and also spent approx. 5-8 mins with me, ending off with an ""everything looks good"",till one day I had a bad case of food poisioning from tainted fruit. I was not feeling well at all. My family took me to the doctors office and Dr.Q admitted me to the hospital. Dr. Q took me off my one bp medicine that was working for me for years and put me on a few medications,one of which was the Lotensin. my bp was extremely low the lowest 97 over 70 but my heart rate was 110. Since I left the hospital, I thought the symptoms that I was having from this was just me until my daughter happen upon this site. I also had the pounding racing heart and the dry hacking cough, the persistent often embarssing built-up saliva in my mouth and the agonizing post-nasal drip associated with it. I feel very light-headed where I move and talk extremely slow and 85% of my day is spent in bed because I cannot function the way I normally function. I live an independant, lively, engergetic, agressive, competitive lifestyle, that I want back not only for me but for my family as well. Needless to say, I insisted for him to take me off it and to put me back on my orignal bp medicine. He refused to put me back on and insisted that I follow his orders or find another physician and since the time Dr.Q made that comment he had already released me from his care leaving me to find someone else. Ask questions, find out by researching(medical professionals hate that)on the internet but go to reliable resources. Dr.Q's speciality is pill pushing and laptop carrying.

My bp was text-book perfect at 140/80 the entire time I took this. When I commented to my Family MD about the post-nasal drip, he told me this was so common they just refer to it as ""Statin Syndrome"" and changed me to Diovan. This was the biggest mistake I've ever made. My bp is all over the place, I'm sicker than I have been since before the surgery, or ever that I can remember. The worst stomach cramps I've ever had and cannot keep anything down. I've fallen twice required sutures/staples, so instead of returning to the Lotensin, they added HCTZ. My feet look like they're going to burst, I'm too weak to stand without help, terrible pain in my back (kidney area) on both sides. I have to go to the ER tomorrow to have the staples removed and I will insist on dropping the HCTZ and Diovan and return to Lotensin. After all, YOU have the final say in what treatment you receive. Your MD only sees you (if you're lucky) maybe 15-30 min./day while in the hospital. So far, with ER visits for falling, I've been given four different instructions regarding these bp med from four different doctors! What does one do, I suggest checking their qualifications, specialties, certifications, continuing education,etc. With the HCTZ, I was told to check my bp twice a day and if it was high, take one, if not, don't (!?!)

This drug has not been tested and approved by the FDA for treatment of ADHD. It actually has only been approved to treat high blood pressure. Similarly, it has not been found to be helpful in treating ADHD in children under 12 or even safe. The use of this drug is not recommended for children under age 12. I understand that it is often prescribed, but you should be aware that many doctors do not know that this drug has not been tested on children and is not approved to be given to them. Studies have been done on children over age 13 and have shown a marginal impact on ADHD behaviors. High Blood Pressure medicines have been found to impact mood and even cause depression. If your child has calmed down it is likely due to a lowering of their blood pressure, not addressing of their ADHD. Read More Read Less  "

This med made her paranoid and i had to put an extra blanket over her window cause she think someone is watching her. She said there is a man in her closet so I had to put a lock on the closet door. And she absolutley will not sleep with a night light-she has to have her bedroom light on. She screams constantly and runs thru the house like something was after her. She has been off this med for about 2 weeks now. She still screams all the time but at least she sleeps in her own bed now...It takes her about 4-5 hours to fall asleep with or without meletonion. She sees a new psy doctor this month.Read More Read Less

Tried everything from eye glasses to anxiety meds. Nothing worked. My local doctor in early 70s diagnosed it as vascular headaches but had no good med for it. Only relief was strong pain meds but did not stop attacks. The headaches were very debilitating.  I would have to lie down in a dark room for several hours. Often had to leave work because of the headaches. About 35 years ago another doctor diagnosed me with same as earlier doctor. Vascular headaches. These can be caused by weather changes, certain foods, stress,etc.  He put me on 240 mg of verapamil. As meds kicked in the headaches went away.  Later cut meds to 120 mg per day.  I have been virtually free of these headaches since then. I went from several headaches per month to I cannot remember when I had my last one. I am concerned about the long term effects of this med, but this is the last med I will stop taking unless something better is out there. Cheap and effective. It gave me my life back.

After one month of daily usage, during a morning jog, I was suddenly thrown to my knees by a pounding arrhythmia that sent me to the hospital. I was immediately taken off the drug and given a battery of tests to determine what happened. Although the arrhythmia was verified during a stress test, as a runner, I've never had any heart problems before the verapamil. To this date, I suffer from arrhythmia, though at a much reduced intensity and frequency.

Everyday I felt out of it… like I was going to pass out but never did and my bp was never low.

So my physician started me on Diovan/Hydrochlorothiazide 160/25--this worked  for me without any obvious side effects.  After a few years my kidney function decreased very slightly which is a known side effect, so my physician decreased the hydrochlorothiazide to 12.5 mg.  In general I like this medication very much.  It controls my blood pressure, and I don't have any obvious side effects.

It has really helped, along with diet, getting my blood pressure to an acceptable level. The doctor is pleased with the results. As for side effects: I do experience dizziness sometimes when I stand up quickly. So, I have learned to rise slowly and that (usually) keeps the dizziness at bay. It does cause me to have more bowel movements than I had before, and that is annoying but nothing that alters my life. Finally, I have noticed it does not mix well with alcohol at all, at least for me. And I am not talking binge drinking or excessive drinking. Even one or two drinks usually gives me a headache, and I did not have that prior to going on Diovan.

 So my  doc then put me on the combination Valsartan Hydrochlorothiazide  and after about 3 weeks on that combination now my BP is 120/80 and often less than that.

After delivery ,I was in a different unit, they gave me more labetalol and every single time I took this (whether with food or without) I’d vomit everything I’d eaten. Doctors blamed it on other things but I knew it was because of labetalol. Now I know not everyone gets the reaction I did… but it made my life worse.

6227,Labetalol Oral,6/2/2023,,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,High Blood Pressure,3.0,4,4,1,"Shortly after I was put on Labetalol I developed muscle pain in my legs when walking.  It was exactly the same pain I had when I was taking statins for high cholesterol. (I'm unable to take any statins for that reason.)  I was unable to walk for more than 5 minutes before the pain became too much.  I didn't identify the connection between Labetalol and the leg pain, which led me see multiple specialists and undergo MRI's and x-rays of my back.  I finally made the connection and, at my cardiologist's direction, stopped Labetalol.  Within a week my leg pains ceased!  I was then put on a different beta blocker which is not causing the problem.  Labetalol can cause muscle pain.Read More Read Less  "

The first couple days my head became tingly and super itchy. After 6 days on it I had swollen feet, chest pain, insomnia,  itchy head, and headaches. My doctor wouldn't answer me, the pharmacist couldn't tell me or the nurse line if I could stop cold turkey after 6 days. 

So I'm tapering off and went down to half over 3 days with monitoring. The side effects of this medicine is worse than the high blood pressure. "

I was diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia with a bp usually around 150/100. Was put on procardia but that did not even touch my blood pressure. It actually started getting a little higher. Went to the emergency room a few days ago and my blood pressure hit 160/100 something. And they decided to put me on labetalol 200 mg twice a day. It instantly dropped my bp to 130/90 and then 10 mins later went to 120/80 and then 120/76. It was amazing! There are some weird side effects I’d say, but nothing scary where I want to stop it. There’s definitely tingling of the scalp , dizziness when I stand up , a feeling of heaviness every once in a while, and nausea but I take zofran with it to help with that. I’ve also only been on it for 3 days now so hopefully that’s all that happens. But I’ll update this if anything changes.

Had three miserable years first with Lisinoprile and then Cozaar.  Lisin turns people into zombies, very weak ones at that, dropping heart rate to ""no quality of life state"".  In desperation was put on losartin, a generic of Cozaar and decided there must be striking differences between the two.  Along with the losartin, I started felopipine again and the last several years have been perfect.  Rarely take my BP anymore and when I do I am 110/68 HR about 60.

Note, I also take Xanax 1 mg 2 X daily if needed, mainly at night and have found I do not need as often sense I use the patch, nor my pain medicine as often. Stress can often make chronic pain worse and this patch does help mine.  I do, however, seem to want to nap more often, but do not feel drugged which is nice.

6585,Nifedipine Oral,2/1/2024,25-34,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,High Blood Pressure,2.7,4,1,3,"Had an emergency c section 1/12/24, because of high blood pressure/pre eclampsia. I was on labetalol and continued to throw it up, had horrible high blood pressure on that one and doctors switched me to nifedipine. All blood pressure meds make me feel horrible. Nifedipine gave me a burning pain in my brain, all over inside my head, it just burns and throbs and I get the worst headache, I also have eye pain. I also have a consistent heart rate of 112-130bpm which for my little heart is a lot. —
 I’m 5’1, female, weighed about 204lbs during pregnancy,160lbs prior.. but I didn’t have hypertension until the end of my pregnancy. And postpartum.
~~~~Nifedipine makes me feel like I’m living in an out of body experience. I feel out of it, loopy, almost drugged, my thinking becomes disorganized, I can’t follow conversations, I pretend a lot because doctors had accused me of being on drugs because I had hypertension. (Apparently it’s pretty common to be accused of drug use when you deliver early or late or have high blood pressure or your baby is preemie or overweight, go figure). But another issue, for example, I will be talking with a healthcare worker and they’ll ask me a question and it’s as if I cannot focus on what they’re telling me :( before I could think clearly, comprehend conversations, laugh back, but I feel sedated, lucid…shaky, unwell and this med has given me extreme sense of paranoia and anxiety. Which as a postpartum mom, I have to pretend I don’t feel any of that, otherwise they can take my baby away (they already think, I suffer from postpartum depression and on drugs (which isn’t true) but the only med, I’ve been taking is this one. It controlled my blood pressure (so it looks great on readings) but I feel I am going to have a heart attack and die at 32. I legitimately can’t handle the tachycardia on a daily basis caused by this medication. The other side effects is SEVERE water retention, (if I bring this up with my providers they say “it’s normal for you to retain water since you had pre eclampsia”) but I have a huge feeling it’s these pills!! My feet and ankles swell up like balloons. 
———
I was in the hospital postpartum for 7 days. While they regulated my blood pressure, worst 7 days of my life. Nifedipine allowed me to go home, because it did stabilize my blood pressure, but at what cost? My heart feels like it’s failing. My body is spent …
——-/
It also constantly feels like I’m short of breath. Almost gasping to breathe, and very fatigued. 

Doctors mentioned they will be hopefully decreasing my dosage now that I’m postpartum. Please, send me good vibes and prayers so I can get off this medication.

Labetalol no longer keeping blood pressure down after delivery, nifedipine was added it helps bring my pressure down and I don't get the palpitations because the labetalol keeps the heart rate down, but now Im just dealing with the aches and pains and feeling down most of the day.

6588,Nifedipine Oral,10/22/2023,35-44,Female,,Patient,High Blood Pressure,2.7,4,2,2,"Started 30mg extended release at 28 weeks pregnant for high blood pressure. My bp was running between 145/90 and 165/98. This medication worked to control my blood pressure, lowering it to a range of 117/75 to 130/85. 

However, the side effects have been rough. After taking this medication for over a month, I still have daily episodes of heart palpitations. My heart rate will get as high as 170bpm for up to an hour. It usually happens about 2 hours after I take the medication, and almost completely paralyzed me where I cannot do anything for that time apart from concentrate on my breathing. 

Because I am pregnant, my doctor says there really is no other option and nifedipine is the safest. I’ve been referred to mental health, and told I’m having panic attacks from hormonal changes from pregnancy. I know this is not the case, as the pattern of palpitations is too consistent. 

Like others have reported, this medication also gives me restless legs and a feeling of weakness throughout my limbs. 

I do not like this medication. Even on a low dose, and after a month, the side effects are barely manageable. The heart palpitations are worrisome, even though the doctors write it off. I feel it can’t possibly be good for the baby. Read More Read Less  "

It does nothing for pain. Or piles. (hemorrhoids)
I cannot say definitively, if it's the ""healing factor."" I am only using fissure medication. Lidocaine 2% and Nifedipine. 
Lidocaine gel/Nifedipine don't shrink piles, Lidocaine mildly kills pain, it increases movement though.
They are both helping. Along with eating more fibrous fruit and veg. Though I already ate more fruit and veg. than anyone else in the house already... Not much more 1-2 extra servings. 4 to 5 a day, total now.
I couldn't be more pleased with the Nifedipine. It's a fairly cheap price, for 1 jar. I have more than a month's worth here. Compared to the other gel $$$. Though I wouldn't be able to walk without the Lidocaine gel. No side-effects from either. Everything is fine, except for spikes of pain. It took 4 days, but I was able to walk the dog finally. I even mowed the lawn. But that was too much. Ouch... I'm paying for it today. Chronic diarrhea caused the problem. The Dr. said to use this stuff until it's gone. Hopefully no surgery.

The second symptom was extreme tremors also in early morning after getting out of bed lasting sometimes more than an hour. Like being in a major earthquake.    After taking this drug for 42 days I decided to stop to see if it played a factor in these new symptoms. The same day I stopped I also had a heart dr appointment. I informed him of the new symptoms.

I tend to automatically get the terrible side effects if there are any! (No luck for me) I waited until my roommate was home just in case of fainting, dizziness, vertigo and/or light-headedness did occur. I took the dose and a bit later I had this ""calmness"" come over me. I definitely didn't get drowsy but I felt like everything was ""ok""(I hope that makes sense) so I was able to relax and go to sleep. I had dreams, quite lucid; but pleasant dreams. No nightmares at all. In the morning upon waking, I momentarily thought I was late waking up but my head cleared quickly and I was clear-headed, not in a fog like most sleep meds tend to make me feel post-use in the a.m. I'm quite thankful to my new doctor for suggesting this previously unknown (by myself) medication to me as it's only been 2 days and I'm already feeling so much better throughout the day!

Doctors only ever fluffed me off and gave me typical anti depressants and anti anxiety drugs. These didn’t address what was crippling my life. This past January I had a different doctor taking over for the regular and we had a good chat. She said it was a stab in the dark but tried me on .5mg prazosin. I didn’t put much stock in it. After about a week I started seeing changes. (My husband of 20 years (who is truly a great man and never has ever given me any reason to be scared or worried about his behaviour towards me) - unfortunately, my nervous system decided that he was an enemy (I don’t know how he stuck with me through  it all- but am so glad he did). 
It’s like my whole life has been renewed by this tiny pill.I lost so many years to C-PTSD. My nervous system is not stuck on. (A ringing phone still triggers flight response- I work with seniors - my body still has a visceral reaction to a handsy old man who thinks he’s playing by rushing fast at you down the hall- 
My nervous system now can recognize that there is absolutely no danger from my husband. 
Taking it day by day- it was something I had no control over - other meds and mindfulness were of zero help- so there is a part of me aware that this blessing of „good times“ can vanish again for no reason. Read More Read Less  "

After a week or so I was getting to where I didn't even want to leave the house. It had such an affect I was thinking everyone had a problem with me, or was against me. It costed me my badge, and I almost lost my company. I actually ran out and hadn't made it to the pharmacy to get my refill when I started noticing small things. But this is after maybe two days or three. The thoughts, and feelings were no where near the same. I've slept like a champ this past week. I've been up out of the bed no later than 7. I'm still getting dizzy some but not as bad. It hit me once when I was in the shower. I was home alone and all I can recall was coming too with a wound that required stitches. Luckily it wasn't my head. Now I'm having to replace the shower walls with tile. ""I'm 6'1 185lbs athletic"" hints why I messed up the shower. But I'm still adjusting back to me and my PTSD.

I  have had flashbacks for 27 years, which became severe when I had to wear a hard cervical collar for several months.  My symptoms confused doctors because they interviewed my family repeatedly, who saved face by denying everything.  Antipsychotics, benzodiazapines, and antidepressants failed to control my anxiety and depression.  I was informed that I was delusional.  I eventually developed a prescription opiate addiction in a horrible attempt to cope with the craziness I felt everyday, causing even more serious problems.  It all came to a turning point in April 2017, when I attempted suicide after an old man snuck into my bedroom while I slept and I awoke to his hands on my face.  In my panic, I thought he was my father and I was 7 years old...I was seen at a new hospital after that, by doctors who finally believed me, not my family and started me on Prazocin.  21 months later, only on Prazocin 13 mg/day & Pristiq, therapy is finally working and I have 21 months clean.  The nightmares and daytime flashbacks have stopped, and I am able to live each day with radical acceptance of life as it really is.  My past is finally ""in the past"" in my mind for the most part, and when I become really angry, I search for emotional triggers in that current situation that are reminding me of my violent alcoholic father and the mother who didn't protect me from him.  For the first time in my life, at 52, I truly began the process of forgiving them both, healing and moving on.  I am slowly rebuilding my life, physically healthy and emotionally much stronger.  Prazocin and professionals who paid more attention to the woman in front of them instead of the lies of others with a guilt-covering agenda saved my life, and I am happy and at peace today,for the first time.  This is my miracle.Read More Read Less  "

I took it for about six months during which I came down with chronic fatigue and for several months slept over 20 hrs per day.  Since the symptoms took nearly three months to appear and came on so gradually we did not equate them to the prazosin.  My wife finally realized it could be the medication, looked it up and I immediately stopped taking it.  It took nearly two months for me to get back to only sleeping about 14 hrs a day.  I spoke with my urologist who immediately switched me to Tarizosin which resulted in the same problem about three months out.  The second time we realized the problem about two weeks after manifestation and I quit taking that.  It is now 13 years out and I still have fairly severe chronic fatigue, needing to sleep at least 11 hrs per day on average and went from an IQ of over 140 to being diagnosed with early onset vascular dementia.

On one particular night, it was so bad, I thought I was going to have to go to the ER, but I didn't, and I didn't get to sleep till around 8AM the next morning. I contacted my heart doctors office and told them of the symptoms, and let them know I'm not taking 2 doses daily, that I was only taking one, once daily. After taking only one dose daily, I was still lethargic, zero energy, depressed, my vision was still changing, so I cut it to a half dose at night for 2 weeks. My energy level is better, not depressed, but vision is still changing, so I've stopped taking it completely as of 01/02/2024, and I'm not taking it anymore. I haven't told my heart doctor yet, but I will when I see him next month. I figured out what's causing my heart rate beating higher than normal, which is too much coffee at night, and smoking.

A few years ago I was on it and developed major anxiety, sinus infections and cough. Severe on all levels. So went off the drug and those things went away... took a while for the anxiety to stop however.  About 5 months ago, my protein leak spiked so I tried this med again at 5 mg. After a couple of months cough, water weight gain (10 lbs), anxiety and major neck and shoulder pain. Went off of it. Dropped weight and pain and anxiety fairly fast... probably as I wasn't on it as long as first time. So a month after being off the Altace, protein spikes again. So thought I'd try low dose. 1.25. No effect on the protein leak but stopped losing weight immediately and neck and shoulder stiffness. Doubled the dose to 2.5 a week ago and within a couple days severe neck and shoulder pain and water retention.. started gaining even though I jog everyday and am on a calorie restricted diet. Today I have made the decision I can't take this med. At 2.5mg the protein is reduced but I am miserable. I am also major allergic to Atacand.. Angiodema caused vocal chords to swell and it took 5 weeks to heal after coming off that drug. So I have no proteinuria drugs I can take.

6709,Dyrenium Oral,4/26/2015,45-54,Female,1 to 6 months,Caregiver,Other,3.7,5,5,1,"Mother went to a hospital with an acute bout of diverticulitis.Eight days later she came out of hospital. She was incredibly weak and taking three diuretics a day and two blood pressure meds. One month later, she hit ER with SEVERE cramping through body, a potassium level of 5.7 and spent daily trips to hospital and PCP for aggressive Tx, labs,and diligent scrutinizing of metabolic panels. BTW: med was contraindicated due to stage 3B kidney failure; PCP missed hospital report that stated that she was taking three diuretic pills a day (one was furosimide)and it took a month and Mom showing me the indentations that didn't leave her fingertips and a hospital visit or two - more actually - and at least three Doctors from the clinic to begin turning this around. Being on this medication dropped her GFR to 23(rather than ~36ish it had been previously running). These numbers are according to the Comprehensive Metabolic Panels used to evaluate and monitor her condition.Her BUN shot to a whopping 48(healthy range being 8-21mg/dL); creatinine climbed dramatically to 2.11 (rather than the recommended 0.44-1.03 mg/dL);and Potassium to 5.7, at which point it is quite notably dangerous to both heart and kidneys.If I had not Mom to the ER for the dehydration and pain (for which the ER Doc was at first annoyed with us being in the ""emergency room"" for cramps and directed her to ""drink tonic water""), I really think I would not have her with me today.Read More Read Less  "

As patients and consumers how can we be ensured access to medications that work for us?  The drug companies buy each other and pharmacies buy from various suppliers; drugs are from other countries not made in the USA! Since we are paying the price monetarily and physically; we should have access to medications that work best for us as individuals.  Generic drugs ingredients vary and obviously not the same efficacy across the board. Its like playing Russian Roulette being forced into trying various generic drugs.     Read More Read Less  "

Spinal Fusion surgery with considerable blood loss, I began having a rapid heart beat, but ONLY when trying to stand up from my hospital bed. It had been an issue in the past as well, as I have undergone MANY (20+) spinal surgeries,and I felt dizzy & light-headed following those procedures also.I had NOT been treated with medication, in a few cases I simply required a transfusion to restore my lowered blood level and some additional rest. This time, the hospital's cardiac Dr on call put me on Toprol 25, which helped, but in general, my symptoms went away after about 3-4 days.Afterwards, at my follow-up with my Primary Dr., I was found to have hypothyroidism, and he started me on Levothyroxine, and continued the Toprol as he felt the thyroid replacement could cause rapid heart beat in the beginning. About 8 months later I began to have severely increased fluid retention in my legs despite being on a long term diuretic. They felt puffy and weak, my walking was extremely limited with barely enough energy to walk down my driveway. I have NEVER had to watch my weight,and I very rarely gain due to over eating. Suddenly I began to pack on pounds despite no change in my diet, though it seemed the additional weight was restricted to my legs and feet, while the rest of me remained the same. (I am on the smaller side, 5'1"", and 100 lbs.) Reducing my intake was of no help at all, and I was tired, lacked stamina, and had little interest in my usual hobbies. I slowly began to take fewer and fewer Toprol tabs and immediately saw a reduction in the leg puffiness, and feeling of excess fluid in my legs and feet. My stamina is slowly returning to normal, and I am hopeful I will be back to normal soon in the near future.Sometimes all that's required is rest and letting nature take it's course to heal to return to my old self.

Found out it was not working, so went back and got Capoten ,problem solved . Well solved until Capoten became unavailable few years ago.

Most times pressure stays the same after taking it , and at the most it will bring it down 10 points . Possible that i've become resistant to it or need additional meds .

My only symptom is an occasional mild pain around where I was resectioned. I feel no side effects taking 100mg/day. It is important to get a blood test every 3 months to watch for lymphoma.

I have consistently been on methotrexate for many years, with first enbrel that I failed after 6 years. Then on to remicade infusions which I also failed. Next came Rituxan and even though I felt so much better on Rituxan my rheumatologist though my inflammatory numbers were staying way to high. He switched me to actemra. Right away this med made me feel awful. Non stop headache for 10-14 days following infusion, doubling over stomach pains, my blood pressure literally went so high 230/136 range and my feet and ankles swelled terrible. Then came my blood work and it was the worst ever. Even worse than when I was first diagnosed. He stopped the actemra right away after a few infusions. I am back on the combination of mtx injections, Rituxan infusions, gabapentin and celebrex. This is a good combination for me and I’m probably as good as I can get.

Then I started Actemra which dramatically reduced inflammation from 90% down to single digits. I could kneel again, take long walks, stand in line, etc. I got my life back. It's been two years now and, unfortunately, the side effects are increasing. Fatigue is significant in that I haven't been able to work due to exhaustion resulting in illness, I developed mouth sores, as well as the usual increased sensitivity to airborne illnesses. I've had shingles and continue to experience rib pain from the latent virus. I'm now in bed with mumps! We will be switching meds this month. So I'm ambivalent.

All I did was go home after work, eat supper and go to bed. On my days off at best I would accomplish one minor activity before having to stop for the day. And the RA was spreading from my fingers, hands and wrists to my toes. Always in some amount of pain even taking a 24 hour prescription pain med.

She is 17, and doing AMAZING because of ACTEMRA!! Her doctor just smiles at each visit and shakes his head in amazement, because it is like she is healed! Her range of motion is normal now! We are so happy:) Finally, after all these years, they found what works for her. We tried methotrexate, Enbrel, Orencia, but nothing helped. Enbrel actually made her worse. It locked her joints up. I hope more people will get to try ACTEMRA and it will help them, also.

I was having severe pain while breathing (I had a coughing spasm -not sick just had something go down the wrong pipe-so my esophagus spasm-d) in I thought it was pleurisy at first(because I have had pleurisy before-MOSTLY after I was exposed to ASBESTOS about 6-8 yrs ago) then it spread to my side underarm and my whole breast felt painful... then also my shoulder and through my back and tingled down my arm and into my pinkie and ring finger... The urgent care doctor wrote it off as possible tendon/muscle pain.. I will follow up with my PCP but at the moment I am happy because the pain has subsided a bit from this one injection. The injection itself in my buttocks muscle on opposite side did not really feel like anything at first and then it burned and felt painful to the touch at the injection site.. it subsided after about 30 minutes. and the onset for my pain to start going away was about 2 hours or so... it was not instant.. The down side is that I have a CRAP ton of energy and I am sitting here typing this up.. LOL... BUT I did not need any OPIOIDS for my pain... and that right there is AWESOME!

I feel like I've been sicker on Cimzia than any other of my biologic medicines and I've been on 3 over the past 9 years or so.

Interestingly it has also seems to virtually eliminated the mild BPH symptoms that I was experiencing before starting the drug. I would expect a bump in my cholesterol (next blood work will be in a week or two) but this is a known side effect that can be managed with statins if required.

I've been taking 20mgs for 4 weeks now.  It's taking some time but I can see a big difference.  Hardly no pain in my hands as I had before and dexterity has improved.. I have experienced different symptoms as my body is adjusting.  Diarrhea for few days off and on but it passed.  Had tingling in my finger about 20 minutes on a couple different of days but haven't had any other side affects.  Tingling is gone. For me, this medicine has bettered my quality of life.  Forgot to mention, I had major oral surgery while on it and had no issues.My rheumatologist is monitoring me regularly and has been very informative. I've been patient, it takes time for it to work.

My hair started falling out, got a dry cough, had the red spots on my body, tingling feeling in my leg, and then I began falling.  After the 4th fall X-rays and a ct scan I told the doctor I wanted off the medicine.  He put me on detox for a week which makes you so sick you cannot eat.  This medicine has left me with peripheral neuropathy which I saw on another web sight as showing up in patients post market. I now use a walker and am in physical therapy.  I have been so very weak and ill.  If I had had any idea this drug could do this to me I would not have taken to begin with.  Big Pharma should be ashamed of itself.

I also suffered some horrible heartburn/reflux, but Pepcid to the rescue for the win! I started taking 20 mg three months after being on 10 mg. Everything was pretty much the same until Christmas Day…that’s when the diarrhea started, and it still hasn’t stopped after 2 weeks. I spend more time on the toilet than I do anywhere else, and I’m exhausted. I did stop taking leflunomide almost a week ago, but this diarrhea is practically nonstop. I take Zofran and Imodium, and I eat 5-10 crackers a day (if I’m lucky), but it exits just as quickly as it entered. My rheumatologist prescribed colestipol, which I just started taking yesterday. I’m crossing my fingers that it helps because I don’t know what else to do.

My PCP and rheumatologist are both telling me that if the diarrhea continues, I should see a GI…why would I do that when I know what’s causing it?! It’s frustrating that the doctors seem to not want to acknowledge the horrible side effects from this medicine. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy, but I wonder how doctors would handle it if they had to experience what we are ??Read More Read Less  "

During the 3 years, he was first put on Methotrexate.  When that didn't seem to work anymore his RA doctor switched him to Cimzia.  When the Cimzia stopped working the RA doctor put my husband on Arava (Leflunomide).  After 5 months he started having life threatening conditions (severe anemia caused by myelodysplastic syndrome).  His RA doctor said this was caused by the Leflunomide.  They tried to flush it out of his system but that didn't work.  His immune system was so weakened that sepsis was able to gain hold.  In the end he died from severe septic shock and pneumonia (in a matter of 5 hours).  Stay away from this medication!  The warnings say it can be fatal and they are correct.  The RA doctor didn't seem surprised that my husband (who was otherwise very healthy) died.  What the heck??  I'm sure his RA doctor is continuing to prescribe Leflunomide.  My husband wasn't just ""an unusual case"".  He golfed twice a week and went to the gym twice a week until the Leflunomide became so toxic that it attacked his bone marrow and shut down his systems.

It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

The prednisone helped, it eliminated the issue I was having.    The down side is that the side effects were pretty strong. The first day I halved my dose, I experienced hallucinations and spent an afternoon in ER. It also made my face and hands swell, and increased acne. The acne isn't too bad, but it might be worse if I were on the medication longer. Other side effects I've experienced include elevated mood (which was not unpleasant, but not normal), intense pressure in head and eyes, blurry vision and random racing heart rate.     I'm ordinarily a very health woman. I work out 5 days a week, eat healthy, sleep 8 hrs a day etc...

In a very few days I was enormous. My face was a moon. I'm still trying to lose the weight. In addition, I had trouble sleeping, being hyper, having some bipolar symptoms and terrible swelling. I realize that one man's trash is another man's treasure, so I can only judge my experiences with the drug. A few days ago my doctor prescribed prednisone 5 pills for 2 days, 4 pills for 2 days, 3 pills for 2 days, etc. I did take the first dose, then realized just what I was doing. I refused to take the rest of the pills. Such a relatively low dose/short term regimen might not have caused any ill effects, but I decided I didn't want to find out. So many of the reviewers here have had much more serious problems to begin with than I, and equally, much more serious adverse reactions to prednisone; however, I felt I needed to speak out about my own experiences and reactions.

I find it ironic that I am on Remicade infusions which cost $5000 each time (every 2 months) which do nothing for me but 20 mg of prednisone daily give me my life back.

My initial dose was 90 mg/day!  Try weaning from that dose!  I was (after many, many incorrect diagnoses) finally diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis.  It has taken two years of my life.  Prednisone is a vile and evil drug.  I have been through hell with muscle pain, writhing on the sofa, still taking morphine to even appear to be somewhat ""normal"", to shower, walk, breathe, raise my head from my pillow.  The simple things.  My face swelled so much that my eyes were slits, barely able to do their job.  I spent almost a year in bed.  Missing all holidays, birthdays, family, friends...  Was there a choice?  No.  Did I have good doctors to support me?  Yes.  Was it my Rheumatologist?  No.  Was it my Primary Care Dr. who prescribed the 90 mg then no longer wanted to see me? No. It was the love of my life,  my Oncologist!  Yes!  He was by my side and saw me through every ugly event.  And there were soooo many!  I was also fortunate to have skipped over the mental side effects.  I didn't chase my husband with a skillet, threatening to kill him as my girlfriend did.  I did keep a good sense of humor.  My Neurologist (found about a year too late) has helped me through a lot of the pain in each and every muscle in my body and my head.  Topomax was a huge success in that area.  It helped to alleviate some of my 700+ day headache and also was effective in helping me loose some of the weight I have gained from Prednisone.  So, I guess there is hope.  I'm alive, I don't suffer from debilitating headaches, and I'm not blind.  I'm unsure of the status of my muscles, tendons and ligaments, bones, teeth, etc.  We'll see in the next year or so when, hopefully, this nightmare is over.

I've been prescribed it when my asthma gets really severe. I've never taken it for more than 2 weeks at a time. I've always been very happy with the results. One of the side effects that I like is that my 60-year-old body has fewer aches and pains while I'm taking it. I'm on my second day of a 5-day treatment and already my breathing is improving. Because of scarring on my lungs via acid reflux I had a doctor want to put me on this med for a year and a half.

7110,Deltasone Oral,9/9/2009,25-34,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Crohn,1.3,1,2,1,"I was very reluctant to take any corticosteroid, as I was worried about side effects. It took more than 10 years of disease activity before I gave in and finally took it. My doctor has prescribed it before, but prior to this year, I had never even filled the prescriptions.    I wish I wouldn't have given in. I thought maybe I was blowing the risks out of proportion, as my GI doctor has told me numerous time that I was overreacting, and that the drug was the safest of any.    Prior to being treated with prednisone, I had suffered through my symptoms, or taken medication that only controlled my symptoms.  I was much happier with both of those options, as miserable as the disease can be. I wasn't depressed before, now I am. I've been off of the steroids a month now, and I still have menstrual bleeding that started 3 months ago when the prednisone was started. It has been nonstop. My doctor said it would stop, and that it was nothing to worry about. Maybe she doesn't feel like having a relationship with her husband, I desperately want one with mine.      My skin is now very oily and I have terrible acne. I was told this would go away, but it's getting worse. My vision is blurry still, my eyes are dry and red, and they feel like they are filled with sand. I was told this was caused by my disease, not the drug. My eye doctor disagrees.      I was unable to sleep much despite being physically drained the entire time while on the medication. It was awful. Anti-anxiety medications didn't help. I also started having trouble with weakness after starting the medication. It was terrible. I could barely walk to my bedroom.    My advice, if your gut feeling is to run from this drug, run, and run fast. I had far less trouble with being on, and coming off of pain medication that I took to control the symptoms of my disease. They said those weren't safe, but I had no ill effects during or after treatment. They should be more cautious in prescribing this this as they are with pain medication.Read More Read Less  "

It made my face swell up, it made my legs and ankles swell to 3 times their normal size.  It made me so hungary all the time and the extra food made my blood sugar worse.   The drug did not help my medical problem asthma at all and only caused  me more problems, which may be a very serious kidney problem.  I was in the hospital this two month period, and I thought they were doing what was best for my health, but that was not the case using this horrible drug Prednisone, I do not believe I should have ever been given this terrible drug.

7118,Mobic Oral,5/24/2023,,,,,Other,5.0,5,5,5,This has got to be the best pain med ever. The only drop is that it raises my pressure so l break the tablet in pieces and it still works. 
7119,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

I have actually  suffered with flare-up symptoms for well over 10 years, but no one could figure it out unfortunately. The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication. I always make sure to take it with food so I will not get dizzy or nauseous, since I have always had a bad case of vertigo with stronger medication‘s.

7128,Mobic Oral,12/14/2019,55-64,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function,5.0,5,5,5," 25 years ago, I took Mobic for back pain pursuant (I later found out) to a c-difficile infection that nearly killed me. Mobic, nor any of the other meds I was given-- helped the back pain at all at that time; and for many years I wrote this medication off as a placebo. However, recently I developed a spontaneous knee injury from long-distance walking. The knee capsule became so inflamed I could not walk or put any weight on my leg. My physician Rx'd Mobic. Lo and behold, it worked this time! It reduced the pain by about 95% and I could walk again. I've taken it for 2 wks and will stop in a few days; I received a cortisone injection in the knee.    Because of some of the long-term side effects, Mobic is probably best used for shorter-term treatments. Clearly, based on my experience, Mobic is not a panacea for all types of pain and many patients will be disappointed that it is not a cure-all. But for joint capsule pain it worked wonders for me. Mobic is a potent medication and MUST be taken with food on a full stomach.   I've come to the conclusion that Mobic, when used correctly for specific types of joint pain, can be very helpful. When used  'shotgun-style' for all types of pain, it is not effective. That is not the fault of the medication. Nor is the mis-use by the patient the fault of the medication, which seems to be part of the problem after reading some of the reviews on this site. Read More Read Less  "

I still have a bit of a lingering headache, but I can function. It at least takes the edge off. I thought that was as good as I could hope for without a prescription. I recently tried Advil migraine due to an inability to get my normal medicine. It worked so well. It worked quickly, within about 20-30 minutes after I take it each time and I feel pretty much back to normal. It was so easy to take. The liquid capsules are small enough to swallow two at a time with ease. I will definitely be switching to this from now on. Read More Read Less  "

Side effects I experienced were dry mouth, mouth sores, itchy rash, dry eyes and some lung problems.  The doctor prescribed Folic Acid 5mg per day to clear up the mouth sores.  It worked well.  I put up with the other side effects because they were the lesser of two evils, the other being RA flares.  Because I was on it so long, the doctor took me off it, without a replacement, and I was okay for a while, but just recently (2010), I had the worst flare of my life!  Maybe it's time to return to MTX.  I use acetametiphen with codeine if I feel a lot of pain because it doesn't bother my stomach as much as NSAIDs.  However, I always have to take them with a stool softener because they can be very constipating.  I also have Fibromyalgia & CFS, and have tried Lyrica and Neurontin for those symptoms.  The side effects were horrendous from both ... I was a zombie and couldn't function. My family begged me to get off them because they were affecting our relationships.

I say this because I am suppose to last six weeks pain free (since this is how often I take REMICADE) but by the second week I start hurting and have to start taking over the counter NSAIDS, by the third week I have to start taking Prednisone and needless to say but by this time, I also look forward and can’t hardly wait for my treatment and two weeks of complete pain free. In addition, I watch what I eat, practice yoga 2/3 times a week (even when I am hurting, it seems to help) and seat in the hot tub. I guess ultimately, the Methotrexate works but only to certain extend; however I do wish I could stop taking it.Read More Read Less  "

We finally went back to it after trying Remicade, Humiara, Enbrel among other injectables. They worked for a while but stopped.  This med is much easier to use than the pill form which made me violently ill. My arthritis has tamed down and I have not had a flare since taking methotrexate.  I have expierenced some strange hair loss that has not grown back even between treatment. I do spend most of the day in bed after my injection. Nausea meds help but I am very tired from the med. I also take folic acid with my injection.  If I had to do it over again I would have stuck with methotrexate rather than try all the other injectables.Read More Read Less  "

The only thing bad I have to say is that I don't feel that the doctors fully explained to me what may happen after the treatment. I had no idea how long it would be in my system. They just said for a while which resulted in me becoming pregnant again and having the pregnancy terminated by the medication that was still in my system.

I had a stuck kidney stone, pneumonia and a Medtronic Reveal XT heart monitor installed all at the same time and had 2 surgeries within a few weeks.  Once I took the Methylprednisone I felt like I could breathe again and actually felt better than I do today.  I was able to do stuff while the prescriptions lasted but once they were out it was back to waking up with headaches puking in the middle of the night, getting dizzy spells, passing out, getting out of breath easy, hip pain, back pain and just overall hating my life because I feel like crap all the time.    Only if it were easy to get this medication once again but the doctors look at me like I'm some sort of crackhead.  I just want to be able to mow the lawn or work on my truck without having my eyes go blurry, getting dizzy and out of breath.

7226,Methylprednisone Oral,5/26/2014,65-74,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Inflammation of the Sac Surrounding the Joint,5.0,5,5,5,"Received 4 mg/tablet dosepak around 6 PM (21 tablets total).  Took first 6 tablets at equal hourly intervals.  Slept 7 hours straight for first time for 4 months.  My problem was severe shoulder pain which WORSENED upon sleeping.  Changing position or sleeping upright did not help.  After taking 1st methylprednisone dose, other swollen or painful tissues and joints also became normal - swollen left hand went to normal size; middle finger knuckle on right hand went from 4 pain to zero pain (scale 0 to 10 where 10 = crying).  Eustachian tubes shrunk which improved my hearing.  Sinuses shrunk, which allowed them to drain (had been blocked for weeks).  Benefits persisted for next 5 days - I hope symptoms won't return.  Taking 500 mg Levofloxacin tablet 1/day for two weeks to treat sinus and Eustachian tube infection helped some, but improvement with methylprednisone was much greater.  With so many benefits and little risk, I suggest having a serious discussion with your healthcare provider if you think methylprednisone could possibly help you.Read More Read Less  "

After trying with no or scars success, several medications (from antihistamine, to antibiotics, decongestants, inhalators, ect)I had been prescribed by a doctor an injection of 2 x 40 mg of Kenalog. The result was incredible, after few days and for a month all symptoms were gone! After that I had been repeating the treatment monthly for a period of 5 years. The firsts visible side effects were skin edemas or profound superficial bleeding in case of a bruise or a scratch, but, much more serious, only much later realized or rather suspected, ... gradual loss of muscular mass (almost 10 Kg out of my 70 !), therefore, consequent loss of fitness, loss of sight, appearing of small warts,on different parts of the body!  During all this time I took several medical tests, which they were showing pretty much normal results, but, among all the doctors that visited me, a part generally advising me that ""the cortisone injections were not advisable"",  no one had been able to clearly warn me and explain to me the specific critical ""side effects"" above mentioned. I have now stopped that treatment since last February and replaced, with some efforts, with homeopathic treatments  but, although I managed to control the symptoms, the unpleasant ""side effects"" in 8 months,... are not yet disappeared or, in a very minimal proportion.

7294,Tac-40 Injection,8/24/2009,65-74,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Skin Disease Characterized by Swollen Itching Lesions,1.0,1,1,1,Medication was injected into lesions that developed on the rear scalp area and lesions that appeared as keloids on the back that developed without trauma. The injections were given every six weeks and were quite painful. The area on the head remained sore to touch before and after the injections but the process continued by two different dermatologist. After 18 months of treatment with the first dermatilogist I switched to another. The process continued at the recommendations of the new dermatologist indicating the lesions were persistent and difficult to treat. A little less than two years went by with more injections and the results were the same. After more than three years of treatment without any positive appreciable change I dropped the dermatologist. The affected scalp area had started scarring where the injectons were adminisstered but the injections continued. The lesions (keloids) on my back grew and hardened. One grew from the size of a navy bean to the size of a silver dollar two others that received injections grew to the size of a quarter. Another that appears as a blemish with a core apparently has a rogue nerve that is very painful. It feels as though someone is stabbing me with a hot poker much more often than I like. All of the lesions(keloids)on the scalp and on the back itch terribly. I suffer from RA (autoimmune disease) and have been prescribed various meds that I know believe may have caused skin problems that were possibly exacerbated by TAC 40. The lesions are still there and it seems there is nothing that can be done about them. Where are the trained experts? Maybe I should get liposuction in those areas to remove the underlying problemRead More Read Less

After I went back in to remission I slowly reduced my dose to 1 - 2x per day.

As other drugs came along, Sulfasalazine was one of the drugs that was prescribed for me in the 70's or 80's.  It worked and no problems whatsoever.  At the beginning of 2020 the cost went up for Mesalamine which I was on at the time so I asked if I could be switched back to the cheaper Sulfasalazine because it worked before.  When covid19 hit the US I did not have symptoms of covid but I developed long haul symptoms of chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, hair loss and brain fog.  All covid tests and antibody tests turned out negative and nobody in my immediate family developed covid.  My primary doctor ordered every sort of testing, plus temporarily took away all the meds she prescribed to try and find the cause of my symptoms.  This testing went on for 2 years.  Finally, at the end of 2021 I told my GI doc and he temporarily took away the Sulfasalazine, and within a couple days my side effects completely disappeared.  I looked back on when the change over back to Sulfasalazine was made and it was Feb 11, 2020.  I  asked my primary why it worked earlier without side effects and not now.  She said the contents were probably the same but the coating might be different.  I did notice the coating was different the second time around I took it.   The new version left a brown chalky residue on my hands and anything I touched before washing my hands.  The earlier version did not leave a residue.

I've had mild side effects, nausea mostly has now passed as long as I eat before taking them.  Constantly tired but I assume this is the RA.  After starting Sulfasalazine (and coming off prednisolone) my symptoms got worse and CRP was 52.  I had to go back on to prednisolone due to pain and swelling.  I'm on weaning dose of prednisolone again now (one 5mg a day) and CRP has crept back up to 11 (lowest was 6).  All this suggests the Sulfasalazine isn't working, and swelling / pain in my hands is slowly getting worse. At next review I suspect I'll be switched to methotrexate.      Read More Read Less  "

I also have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which complicates my situation. Started this about a month ago and I had headaches and some GI symptoms, but my joints have felt better than they had in YEARS. I take it after my meals now so it doesn’t upset my GI tract, and I drink tons of water too. My headaches went away after 2ish weeks, so I lucked out. Turned my pee very yellow, but it’s worth it. This is the first DMARD I’ve tried, I’ve only been on an NSAID (meloxicam) before now. I’m starting to do things I have not been able to do in years.

I read all the reviews here before taking it  for Gout because I was scared. Now I want to share my experience with it. I had untreated gout for like 3 weeks. Left foot was swollen bad. Doctor gave me 20-30mg per day for 7 days. I finally started it after a day of his prescription and I was surprised that in 2-3 days the swelling magically vanished. The only side effect it had was a little tummy ache but nothing an ol bowl of yogurt cant fix. The doctor had also given me a PPI omeprazole before having this med. (before breakfast omeprazole, breakfast, after breakfast prednisolone). 
When i stopped it the 7th day the swelling came back the very next day but somehow it was a bit better and my new NSAID course that started immediately (diclofenac) helped the swelling come down in 3-4 days. So my experience with this med was really good, non scary and insignificant side effects. It helped break down the severity of the goit inflammation. Read More Read Less  "

I have never been a suicidal person but thought several times while taking this medication how easy it would be to put a gun to my head & pull the trigger. I wasn’t upset about anything but would think that I could do it without even having a reason & how easy it would be to just do it & not even think about it. I slept for 2 days, didn’t eat for 2 days, even though I was told it would increase my appetite. I stopped the medicine & the first day off of it I felt the same still had the side effects. Was wondering how long it would take to get out of my system. I know all meds effect everyone different but I will never take this one again & think more warnings should be put out about it. I’m sure it helps some but my side effects were much worse than the benefits. I have seen nothing in the way of improvements for my conditions that it was prescribed for. I did call my Dr. his nurse talked to him gave him the message of my side effects. His nurse called back said the Dr. said he did not think it was the prednisone causing this & suggested I lower the dose to one daily but that if I wanted to stop taking it I could.

The only side effect taking the drug for me was severe burning mouth syndrome, ringing in the ears and an overall dryness. I am concerned with the drug affecting my vision. I stopped taking the drug because of the cost of am eye exam and office visits and lack of insurance. I am not in a flair. After 3 months without taking the drug, my burning mouth is almost gone and am so happy. My OA has now come to life which I had forgotten how painful it is.

Although unsure as to the cause of the pain (x-rays and ultrasound were scheduled) he prescribed Orudis as an anti-inflammatory in order to minimise my pain until a full diagnosis could be achieved. The Orudis SR 200mg capsules (1 per day) did nothing to ease my pain. I completely lost my appetite and experienced significant stomach/bowel discomfort. After the eighth day I suffered a severe heart reaction (enormous chest-thumping palpitations, tingles in left arm, tight chest) which left me feeling weak for several days. ECG indicated that I had NOT suffered a heart attack. Although I do have a family history of heart problems, I have not experienced any heart troubles until this time, hence the noted side effects did not appear to present a problem for me.Read More Read Less  "

I took it before trying anything else for my pain and it works as good, if not better than other NSAIDs. But I must warn those taking ANY NSAIDS(Ibuprophen,Naproxen,etc.) that overuse (long term use or taking more than prescribed or suggested) can lead to dangerous and sometimes deadly side effects. So for you people taking ""handfuls"" of this or any other NSAID drug, talk to your doctor. These types of medications can cause stomach bleeding, kidney and sometimes even liver problems, and they indeed can put unintended stress on the heart that can lead to heart attacks and/or stroke. So please discuss these medications with your doctor if you are taking them long term or in high doses!Read More Read Less  "

It has worked adequately for me most of the time.  It must be taken regularly (I take it twice a day, 75 mg each capsule) so there is a constant level of the drug in your bloodstream.  I always take it with food, just as I would aspirin or ibuprofen.  It has made the pain tolerable without causing any unwelcome side effects, such as drowsiness or that ""loopy"" feeling. One side effect is uneven tanning if you are exposed to a lot of sunlight.  Also, I gained weight when I first started taking it until I realized the medicine was contributing to my increased eating.  Over the past 17 years I've tried many other pain medicines both narcotic and non-narcotic and this one has been the best choice when taking into consideration all the benefits and all the possible bad effects. This medication is NOT habit-forming, which is very important to me.  I keep other pain relievers on hand (narcotic) for those really bad days, but only take those a few times a month so there is never a dependency built up.

Basically this means when my blood sugars are higher than usual, I bolus the dosage to bring levels back down.    My first time using it was last night when my 2 hour postprandial blood sugars jumped to 279. Within an hour after taking a shot, I dropped to 78. An hour and a half after that I was at 74.    I am EXTREMELY impressed as to how good this works for me. Only needed 3 units too.    Don't care for the 12mm needle. Will try the 8mm needle next time I am higher than usual.    I am hoping that between my diet and exercise, coupled with the Humalog, I can get even better blood sugars.    My last A1c about a week ago was 5.3, and that was with several spikes into the 200+ range, using diet and exercise alone. My goal is under 5.0 (4% club).    With this medication, I can vary my diet so it's not so boring, and not be forced to vigorously exercise as much to bring down blood sugars.    I am wondering something though:  Will I gain weight? Lose weight? Or maintain my weight when using any form of insulin?    Don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to 'paying the piper' (AKA exercising) after I eat. I have a lot of trouble fitting the needed time in to do it, and an even harder time getting back down to normal after a 200+ spike, using diet and exercise.    I generally have no trouble lowering my BS if I am 160-180 range, or less.    My fasting blood sugars are usually perfectly normal.    I can see some semblance of a life now that I have this medication. I won't do pills for my diabetes treatment as my blood sugars are usually well controlled. Seems heat & humidity (or a nap after eating) spikes me highly.    I really hope & pray that the endo will continue letting me have this medication.    I like it better than Humulin R which is slower.     Maybe get Humulin R for long digesting carbs like Dreamfields, and Humalog for the 'eat-N-go' carbs.

You have no assurance that proper amount dialed enters your system. You can see how the amounts vary for the same dialed up units as you push the release button with needle up, A weak push delivers nothing while a hard and continuous push delivers 4 or five times more amount. When you are shooting yourself in the back, it is difficult to generate the hard and continuous push, There is probably nothing wrong with the insulin, I use a Flex Touch Pen for long acting insulin shots and it has a perfect spring loaded mechanism that delivers dialed amount every time at every angle and position. Eli Lillly has so many unsatisfied customers that they need to replace or enhance their Kwikpen, We stay with them because it is the only Medicare approved short acting product, We will switch as soon as an alternative appears.

First, the amount of insulin delivered is variable on how hard one pushes, not on the stop position (unlike novonordisks or sanofi pens).  Second, the dosing ""arrow"" variably lines up with the dose amount. Finally, the gray blue color of the pen is not overtly distinguishable from the gray of lantus pens, making it possible to confuse the two (how about a bright and readily distinguishable homolog pen color, like the red lilly uses?).

Looks like they’re making up their profits by using cheaper pens"

7665,Afrezza Inhalation,9/11/2022,55-64,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,4.7,4,5,5,"I don't understand the non-serious reviews of this drug.  If postings here were from real diabetic patients, and experience was one star, a person would explain why that was the case, and try to help others of us with this condition.  I am also surprised at the lack of new reviews - most of these are from 2015, and a few as recent as 2019.  So, for anyone out there currently on Afrezza (in 2022) maybe I can encourage you to chime in and post!
My two ways of using Afrezza are 1) to minimize after-meal spikes, which can be persistent, and 2) for occasions where my blood glucose is hanging at a high level.  Afrezza is much quicker to bring down the high -- sometimes down 100 points in 60-90 minutes instead of 3, 4, or 5 hours when I use Novolog through my pump.  Does it ""work"" every time?  No, but what diabetes control medication ever does?  For me, the quick onset, and relatively short time it takes for Afrezza to leave the body are major benefits.
I would recommend trying it.  Most users of Afrezza find that the ""conversion"" between Afrezza units and liquid insulin units is NOT 1:1, it is closer to 1.5:1 or 2:1 (so you'll need to take 4u of Afrezza to get the same effect as 2u  to 2.5u of Novolog/Humalog - 8u Afrezza inhaled to replace 5u Novolog/Humalog, etc) 
Remember to get the FEV1 spirometry check of lung function before you start as the manufacturer Mannkind specifies.  Good luck. Stay healthy.Read More Read Less  "

Lente human insulin (Novolin L, Humulin L) is available in vials.  Ultralente human insulin (Humulin U) is available in vials.    Insulin lispro (Humalog) is available in vials and cartridges.  Insulin aspart (Novolog) is available in vials and cartridges.    Insulin glargine (Lantus) is available in vials and cartridges.    STORAGE: Unopened insulin should be stored in a refrigerator between 2 and 8°C (36 and 46°F); it should not be placed in a freezer. Insulin vials that are being used can be kept at room temperature for up to a month. All vials should be protected from light and excessive heat. Unused insulin should be thrown away after the expiration date. The vials should never be shaken.    PRESCRIBED FOR: Insulin is prescribed for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.    DOSING: The abdomen is the preferred site for insulin injection, but the sites of injection must be rotated in order to prevent erosion of the fat beneath the skin, a condition called lipodystrophy.    DRUG INTERACTIONS: Several drugs augment the action of insulin and may lower blood glucose to a dangerous level (hypoglycemia). To prevent hypoglycemia when these drugs are used, the dose of insulin may need to be reduced. Such drugs include alcohol, MAO inhibitors like phenelzine (Nardil), beta-blockers like propranolol (Inderal), salicylates like aspirin (Bayer) or salsalate (Disalcid), and anabolic steroids like methyltestosterone (Android).    There are other drugs that augment the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin, but they are less likely to interact with insulin or have less of an effect. Such drugs include tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline (Vibramycin), guanethidine (Ismelin), oral hypoglycemic drugs like glyburide (Diabeta), sulfa antibiotics like sulfadiazine, and ACE inhibitors like captopril (Capoten).    There also are drugs that decrease the effect of insulin. Read More Read Less  "

I don't work anymore so it was easy for me to just stay at home and lay down in the bed. If I couldn't tolerate it I would have ask the dr. for something else I have been on this medication for four months. No one showed me how to use this medicine and some times it didn't go in and it rand ran down my stomach after re-reading the instructions I learned how to use the pen correctly Now I have to remember to eat a evening snack sometimes my glucose will drop low around 5 or 6 am and I have to get something right away. so I drink a cup of milk while I am fixing my breakfast.

I've been on it for about three weeks with no lows - just excellent BG readings.  My insulin needs have also dropped by about a third.  And instead of split doses, my basal with Tresiba is now once a day in the AM. My doctor and I are both delighted with the results I have been having.  I'm using the U-100, and the newly designed pens are far above any others I've handled.  My biggest concern in the beginning was how would it be to work with a 42 hour insulin.  I would suggest reading Novo's full information on Tresiba before converting, because it does address this issue.  But switching over for me was actually very easy.  One important note in their info was that it takes 8 days for Tresiba to reach it's full potential, so  any increases have to be made slowly. I've only had to increase my initial dose by two units, one time, and at this point I believe I'm right on target.  My morning blood sugars are the kind I used to only dream about! :-) I hope more people are given the opportunity to try Tresiba.  As far as the rumors of sky high cost is concerned, the Humalog pens I buy are actually more expensive than the Tresiba!  So, don't believe every rumor you read.  Talk to Novo, and talk to folks that are using Tresiba if you want to know how what it's really all about.  My father had Type 1 diabetes most of his life, and his parents told him that in his life time there would probably a cure.  I've had Type 1 most of my life, and my parents told me that in my life time there would probably be a cure.  Well, I don't see 'the cure' happening any time soon, but until then for me Tresiba is about as close to 'a cure' as you can get. IMHO of course.Read More Read Less  "

I liked levimir over Lantus because of the way Lantus burns.  My doc said this is a 48 hour insulin, yeah right, lol.  My sugar rises crazy in the mornings, way worse than ever on levimir.  I turned to taking a short acting corrective dose in the morning since being on tresiba.  Itâ??s so confusing, I figured a 48 hour insulin would be better at keeping a stable blood sugar for an extended period. This morning issue led me to start taking some humulinN in the am because the peak is just right to bring down the rise while taking tresiba.  Then I take a dose of tresiba in the evening which then holds over. My overall baseline dose amount is the same as when only taking levimir, but the blood sugar is better overall with this combo.  But tresiba by itself sucked.Read More Read Less  "

My evening insulin wasn't lasting nearly long enough. Then there were the peaks and valleys. I switched to Semglee and it was a total game changer. Completely steady activity for 24 hours. Used with the Libre 2 things become much easier to manage. As far as all of the complaints of ineffectiveness and weight gain, I have not had those issues. I'm very active and fit. I hike, I bike, and run. Something every day. Cannot speak for others but it works well for me.
The biggest change for me making the switch was that because it is so long-lasting and steady I became much more sensitive to my fast acting insulin. prior to Semglee there were times my fast acting had to make up the waning activity of my basal insulin.

7772,Semglee U-100 Insulin Subcutaneous,4/6/2023,45-54,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Diabetes,1.3,1,2,1,"I am likely a type 1 that was misdiagnosed as a type 2 years ago (TL;DR I had a suspected (suspected by my Endo) autoimmune episode at 22 yo that destroyed 60-70% of my beta cells.) I had just enough insulin to not go DKA but to not have good control either. MD didn’t do peptide/antibody because there was “no way I was Type1 because I was 26 so bring on Type 2 meds that never really worked right…of course that was totally lack of willpower said my MDs.  I ran 23 years on a mix of every med under the sun and occasional long-acting insulin.  I have had dawn phenomena the whole time which most of my MDs told me was impossible and a figment of my imagination. The Dexcom finally showed it was real and they admitted I might be a type 1.5. 

They supercharged my poor betas with meds and they did the best they could. My beta cells (what was left of them) finally gave up the ghost about 6 weeks ago, according to tests, and I ended up in DKA.  

I responded AWESOMELY to 30 units of IV insulin and m/l 15 units of sliding scale while in the ICU for 6 days.  I was taken off the drip 4 days in and put on 24 units of Lantus (14 AM, 10 PM) with Humalog for sliding scale 4Xs daily.  My control was nice and solid (130 averages).  I was sent home with 1.5 pens of Lantus and used for the first 15 days home.  Control wasn’t hard and my AGP (Dexcom G6) over 14 days was 6.2!!  Express Scripts wouldn’t cover Lantus (I hate our profit driven healthcare system)…I was told Semglee was biosimilar and a 1:1 replacement.  Not even close.  My control is a nightmare on 65 units (35 AM 30PM). It takes 30-40U, over several injections, of Humalog to keep me averaging 160ish.  It’s almost like the Semglee isn’t there at all. Thank God my Omnipod5 training is TOMORROW and I take my last garbage shot of Semglee at 7pm tonight.  I respond great to fast acting and will be solely on Humalog from here on out. 

I have reached out to my PCP and Endo and advocated for any other patients on this garbage.  Express Scripts will allow Lantus IF your MD will go to bat and say it’s not working.  Prior Authorization is possible.  Advocate for yourself and fight for your health!  Get back on Lantus or get on a pump (that’s not hard either…get with a diabetes pharmacist (mine is at my local med center) and they will help you navigate Express Scripts.). Be persistent and ask your MD to truly advocate for you.  You deserve a med that works!  Good Luck to you all.  Maybe someday big pharma and the insurance companies will care about the patient first.  I keep praying for that day to come…JoeRead More Read Less  "

I can't pinpoint the ""peak"" either (which every glargine has - though slight - it has to be accounted for in your control).  This is not an equal product.

Several months ago I started to share the insulin with my cat who is also diabetic.  I know, I know; this sounds totally nuts.  Be that as it may, I recently noticed that both my cat and I are losing our hair.  As the cat and I have no other factors in common besides the insulin, I wonder if that's the problem.  I am not putting this product down as its worked very well for me in the past but could there be an issue due to poor storage, a bad batch, an out-dated vial, or who knows what?Read More Read Less  "

As soon as I injected 12 units I immediately threw up. I had the worst stomach pains. After three day, I stopped taking it and I called my Doc, who sent me to the ER. After many hours, the ER doc said I was fine. (This was about 24 after my last injection.)  My pains did go away. I will not take this medication again. I gave my pens back to the doctor.

I requested a long life insulin as the pills (Glyburide Metformin) had stop working.  I was informed of this 5 years ago that this might would happen. No problem, lantus is easy to use and controls my blood sugar when I stay the course of doing the right thing.  I am up to 60 units in the morning.  I take it in the morning so it will not interfere with my evening cocktails.  This was a suggest made by friends of mind on this medication.  I did inform my doctor and he was ok with it.  I eat right and exercise so as of now no known side effects. So far, I have nothing bad to say about it. Like everything in life you have to adjust to your situation.  I do have Metformin as backup.  That is mostly when I travel and over indulge I will take it in the mornings. I drink plenty of ice water during the day which also helps with keeping blood sugar under control.  From reading the reviews, I notice most of the men had issues with this. FYI, I am a Black male with history of diabetes.  I also know that I may have to switch meds again in about 10 years.

I never had a problem with Humalog turning cloudy but in the past few months I have had to throw away 3 bottles of Novolog because they turned cloudy in the bottle. I am on an insulin pump and I change tubing every 3 days. The last bottle of Novolog I opened I filled the insulin pump one time and 3 days later when I went to fill it again the insulin was cloudy. The Novolog had an expiration date of 12/2014 and is control # BZF0540. The insulin is fine when stored in the refrigerator but I carry it in my pocket in a plastic case made for that purpose. I fill my pump 4 times from a bottle which should equate to about 12 days of use from one 10ml. bottle of Novolog and it is turning cloudy after 1 or 2 uses causing a lot of waste. I keep unused bottles in the refrigerator and 1 bottle at room temperature. This product is inferior to Humalog and I don't like insurance companies dictating which products I can and cannot use as peoples lives are at stake. I also have had days of high blood sugar until I figured out the insulin had turned cloudy and was no longer effective. What good is an insulin that only lasts a few days at room temperature? My doctor tells me she only uses Novolog when treating patients in the hospital and that Humalog and Novolog are basically identical but I suggest in a hospital setting temperature is more controlled and there are fewer variables than when 1 person uses 1 bottle until empty. I am also seeing bubbles in the bottle as well as cloudiness.Read More Read Less  "

Im on the sliding scale which is something everyone should learn about!   If you use this medication correctly You wont have any problems with it.   Most people never learn how to use the medication correctly.   or they complain about weight gain... If you start gaining weight  GO EXERCISE!   I work out 3 to 4 times a week.

The only side effect I have noticed is the extreme weight gain, which I find at 51yrs old is extremly hard to lose.  I have gained over 7yrs on these two insulins about 70lbs. I have even tried Phentermine to help me lose the weight, but it only briefly worked, I have to come off of it for a while, then go back on it for a while for it to have any effect, however the effect is minimal.  I have also since being on both insulins had High Blood Pressure, and High Cholesterol, my Cholesterol has come down, but my good cholesterol is low.  My blood pressure is good for periods at a time, and high sometimes. Although I rate these two insulins High, I wish that the weight gain was not so severe, I feel if the weight gain were lowered dramatically, I would feel far more energetic, and my blood pressure and cholesterol would also become nearer normal.  I would also probably find the Phentermine would work more effectively, and I would be able to stick to a more healthier diet. Read More Read Less  "

I can never seem to get the pen needles to thread correctly on the pen and the whole thing feels incredibly cheap with very poor allowances. From observation it appears the first unit of each injection is less than a full dose compared to the second or third units in an injection and the poor manufacturing allowances just make for a product that feels cheap, sloppy, and inaccurate. The difficulties in threading the pen needle alone are aggravating enough, but right now I'm locked into this particular brand thanks to insurance (which I have an entirely different tirade about).

My insurance made me change to Novolog and i have had my sugar too high. I found that the pens are defective and not giving the dosage you adjust it for. I have sent back 4 pens to caremark and have 2 more bad ones. The defects i found were the pens leak so your not getting the full injection and the gear drives in them have not pushed the plunger down which reduces the dosage. I have to check my sugar more regularly and keep making adjustments to control my sugar. When your injecting yourselves watch the plunger to see if it's moving.Read More Read Less

There is a learning curve associated with using Afrezza.  It took me about three months to figure out how exactly to configure the back of my throat, flatten out the back of my tongue and inhale at the correct rate.  Also, after inhaling I found it's a good idea to exhale through my nose just in case there is any excess powder left over that didn't get into my lungs (it's possible that may have a side benefit by getting insulin into the nasal cavity and slowing long term cognitive decline - JMHO.)    At any rate when I got my blood test results in May,  my A1C had dropped from 8.7 to 7.9 and that was while I was still trying to figure out how to use the device.

My blood sugars have reached more than 500 several times, which never happened in 15 years that I took Lantus. I have gained 10 pounds, lost all motivation, felt weak in my  muscles and tired. I have decreased my caloric intake and increased my activity, including lifting weights three times a week, and still I cannot lose weight. I am curious to see my A1c results this week.

She had samples of Leveimir and in the 3 weeks I've been on it my sugars have dropped from 348 average down to 130. I'm not sleepy all the time. I've been watching what I eat and excising too.   With just using Metformin it didn't seem to matter I would watch what I eat and workout some and it would rarely go below 200. So I just gave up and started eating what I wanted and didn't check my sugars. FOR ONCE I'm on track. I do have to go talk to the Dr about the rash that's developed on my arm.

8006,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,12/2/2023,55-64,Male,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1.0,1,1,1,"Company cheaped out and changed the pen to something that simply does not work well. The prior pen required nothing more than one hand and a little light pressure to press the button and start the injection. Aside from an occasional dose that would be slow to inject, it worked flawlessly. This new pen doesn't work properly. I have bent the needle all three times i've tried to use it so far, and have been unable to administer the prescribed amount successfully. How on earth does a company release a product like this? The problems and flaws are obvious and there is absolutely no way on God's green earth these problems were not encountered during testing. No way. The only explanation is that these problems were ignored. Flat out ignored. The manufacturer of this product has no conscience as no company with a conscience would do this to people who need their product to remain healthy. Shame on them!Read More Read Less  "

My insulin does not seem to work as well using the new Levemir FlexPens!  Have the ingredients also been changed to make the company more profitable?"
8008,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,11/23/2023,,Male,10 years or more,Patient,Diabetes,2.0,3,1,2,Just another company cheating out on there product to make money!  Guess they are saving money on springs! Sort of like the potato chip bags being half full of air. There is no way a diabetic with weak hands can now use this product successfully!  The Levemir FlexPen is now no more than a poorly functioning glorified syringe! Went from good to bad overnight!

8010,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,11/2/2023,,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1.0,1,1,1,"This new pen is junk.   It is poorly designed.  I wish the people who had designed it actually used it.  Then they would know how difficult it is to use.   This new design requires me to use two hands in order to use it. I have had pain at the ejection site, causing bleeding and bruising.  Being a diabetic everyone of these symptoms is bad bad bad for me.   I am now in the process of looking for another company who offers a spring loaded mechanism design.  The FlexTouch worked for me, the FlexPen does not.  Profit over customer.

8011,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/24/2023,,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Diabetes,1.0,1,1,1,"The Levemir FlexPen update/Improvement is a total disaster.
The ""New"" look for the FlexPen is extremely difficult to work with.
You have to use both hands to accomplish an injection, instead of the easy dial, one handed operation and auto injection of the old Pen.
Reduces the amount of injection sites available due to two handed operation.
Needles get bent 
Exteme care must be used while injecting otherwise you tear the skin and requires more than one injection
Only sixty units can be obtained per use requiring more than one injection.
The injector pad must be strongly pressed to dispense the insulin, causing bent needles, pen coming loose, wasting insulin, damaging the injection site, tearing of skin at injection site, and other issues.

This update was obvious to increase sales and reduce cost. 
Novo Nordisk obviously did not test their product and they surely did not test with actual diabetics otherwise they never would have developed this piece of dung.  Profits override customers.

8016,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/10/2023,65-74,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.0,4,1,1,"The new pen design is horrible. Can’t use just one hand any more. You usually need to use larger doses of levemir than Humalog which means you dial the plunger out much farther therefore it’s much more difficult to use because it is not a smooth operation of the plunger. 
At times it stops and you have to restock yourself to finish the dose. Horrible design!

Earlier this year, my sugars were not under control, and the doctor put me on Glipizide 10mg (Watson 461). This brought my glucose levels back down. I then moved, and the new pharmacy gave my Glipizide 10mg (APO). After starting this medication, I woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating shoulder pain. The pain seemed to originate in the shoulder joint and radiated down into my fingers. I originally thought it was my exercise regimen, but realized this could not be as I have been exercising the same way for about 3 years. I then realized that I experienced the same pain when a former doctor prescribed the same form of Glipizide about 8 years ago. I had forgotten about this...but immediately stopped using the Glipizide. Now, after about a month, the pain has almost subsided completely. I also experienced numbness and swelling in my index finger (same side as the shoulder pain). That too is almost gone. I am concerned that neither the doctor nor the pharmacist told me about this side effect; it could have saved me a lot of painful nights.Read More Read Less  "

I cycled through other drugs like Glipizide, but had issues with them as well. Second attempt at using Metformin seemed to go better as I stuck with it through the rash. It seemed to be my solution. So I THOUGHT!  Over the next year or so I was losing control of BM's. I had to be within 15 seconds of a bathroom or else. I thought I was going to need depends for the rest of my life. Totally depresssed. I stopped leaving my house. I sold my car. I missed 3 Graduations and 3 Weddings for fear of an accident. Every time I saw the Dr. I'd mention my issue, but never did they say my Loss of control could have been from Metformin. I didn't think it was related to Metformin either as it came on slowly, over time. I researched and didn't see anyone else say they went through this too. I finally gave up and decided to reset. I stopped ALL my meds for a month and what do you know. I became regular again. I'm pretty mad that my Dr. said NOTHING when I'd mention it and I'm mad at myself that I didn't put 2 and 2 together sooner.  So depressing. I may be able to get afford another car down the road, but I will never get those Family events back. I hate Metformin...Read More Read Less  "

During the last two years, while on Glumetza, I have experienced nothing short of feeling so ill, that I was just waiting to die.  The side effects of Glumetza, for me anyway, was awful. Insomnia, irregular breathing at night, nightmares, irregular rapid heart rate, muscle weakness, headaches, blurred vision, weight loss, and as time moved on the symptoms became worse and more frequent. It reached a point where I could not think straight and experienced an overwhelming sense of doom, something I had heard about but, never experienced.  I called my GP they did some labs.  Everything seemed to be normal with a A1c 6.3%.  I ceased the Medication for a period of six weeks and also fasted 4 days per-week to control BGL.  Slowly after several weeks, I noted a huge change in my symptoms for the better.  By week six, it was as if, I had been reborn. I was elated.  Following my GP's request I started taking it again.  It became obvious after two months I began to experience similar symptoms. This time the night-mares were becoming very violent. I would wake up with heart rates of 200 BPM and chest pain.  I had enough, I took myself too the local ER and explained what was going on, and stopped taking the Glumetza (Metformin ER)  While at the ER, I explained I was a retired ICU Nurse, with 40 years experience and knew what I was talking about.  In their and my favour every test known to mankind was completed on me during the next several months and nothing was found to be out of the norm. My (A1c > 6.7) It has been three months now without Glumetza and I feel great. I my consider taking Jardinance in the future to keep my A1c down.  Never, Never, again will I suggest, recommend or take Metformin again. Read More Read Less  "

Start with 500mg 2x day and build up to 1000 mg 2x day.  After 2 weeks, lost 12 lbs, but the gut wrenching pain, gas, nausea, diarrhea, & now constipation.  Already was on BP and cholesterol meds. So now can't always tell what is causing it, but can because I was feeling quite well til I started taking this RX.  Now I have no appetite, so hard to eat meals, don't drink enough water, due to the gas erupting (both ends), so now getting dehydrated. Trying to eat enough and items that won't cause more gas.  It feels like I am in the original Alien movie, just waiting for it to burst thru my tummy, lower left side hurts the worse with cramping.   But what gets me is we didn't do more tests prior, cuz I learned that stress can also cause A1C to change, and since I had been under alot having to take care of things as my brother passed away in August and taking care of my mother for 2 months, I wasn't necessarily eating the best for 2 months, not meaning bad foods, just skipping too many meals.  So when they state they prescribe this for the better of your health and side effects are suppose to be minimal, I don't agree.  Suppose to go on a group bus trip next month 3-4 hour drive, now I am worried about how will I handle these side effects, as there have been times I feel like I wanted to get to the urgent care or ER, as it hurts that bad.Read More Read Less  "

Metformin made my life a living hell. My appetite vanished, had nausea all the time, had no interest in eating any thing even food that I loved was of no interest to me. this resulted in severe constipation and gas in my stomach which was not coming out. I felt like I was again having obstruction, because when you dont pass gas that is sign of obstruction. There was no benefit in blood sugar levels, they were 140 mg/dl fasting and 180 mg/dl two hours after meal. On 12th day I was fedup and stopped metformin. with in two days my appetite returned, stool become normal, locking and inflation of gas in stomach eased. Ironically, now when my stools are regular my blood sugar has come down and it was 106 mg/dl fasting in the morning (though have diet control, only complex carbs). Now I have reckon that when my figures to up in future this med is not a choice for me and I have to control my sugar with diet and exercise only.

My new doctor suggested stop taking Glimepiride since my A1Cs were so low and the Glimepiride could keep me from losing weight.  I've been off it for almost 2 months now, I haven't lost a bit of weight and my morning numbers have been above 130 and one day it was 178.  I think it's time to go back on it and maybe get another doctor.Read More Read Less  "

I wore out my ability to utilize metformin. My doctor switched me to Tradjenta 5mg and Actos 30mg to replace metformin. After 6 months I started to use Glimepiride 2mg a day just now, first day I crashed a little because I dropped 100 points within 2 hours. When youâ??re not used to that big of a drop you it does not feel good. I had 2 spoons of honey and within 10 minutes felt normal. I have lost over 60lbs over 15 years, lots of hard aerobic exercise, zone diet foundation for eating. One thing that really works for constipation is lots of fiber, I mean psyllium husks based is the most effective aside from fruits and vegetables that are really high in fiber.

A1C kept rising; daily meter readings were erratic. Started glimepiride; no change in A1C; readings were quite high in a.m. Started 30 units of insulin; A1C dropped from 9 to 7.9 to 6.8; morning readings still very high; afternoon/evening readings often drop to 45-60. I attribute this to having to take glimepiride in the morning and not at the same time as metformin.  Asked doctor if I could stop glimepiride and take one of my two doses of metformin in the morning instead of noon; he said no because its working and I just can't see it. Meter readings consistently range between 45-350. I'm seeking another doctor.  Read More Read Less

Have had a couple of lows because I didn't eat enough carbs or ate a very small dinner.  Otherwise, no problems and love seeing my readings in the normal range.    You have to start slow on this med.  I read a review where someone said they took a 4mg pill right off the bat!  Wow!  My doctor had a plan for me to follow to start with just 1mg before breakfast and 1mg before dinner.  I slowly increase until my fasting blood glucose readings get below 130.

At first it was working ok but had to adjust from only Crestor 10mg to both Crestor and Amaryl 1mg. Got some blurred vision and A1C rose full 1.5 PT in 3 months. Changed to Pravachol 20mg b/c of ObamaNOcare. What a crock! Still having issues of blurred vision and A1C issues even with exercise and eating right. Tired most of the time and hard to rise and shine when I was a morning person prior to all the meds. Added MetFormin 1000mg twice/day - What CR?P. What next?? Feel like a hamster in a cage. My guess is any drug is not good! Read the label. Terrible drug that works at first until your body gets use to it or the drug reps are giving bad drugs to the Pharmacy - hope not??

However less than 6 months on the medication along with trying to eat right and exercise. I now am right back at the higher numbers. The side effects are wrecking havoc for me.     I now have numbness along most of my right side. Hand, arm leg and some feet. Huge pain across shoulders as well. Did not injure self at all. But never had issue till took medication.     I had to change from night to morning because the pill dipped me too low in the mornings. Now it does nothing for system.     Use to be 85 in afternoon when got home after taking in the morning. Now I see 180 plus waking up. And recently after numbness set in I am now back in the 200 range.     Would not call this pill a success. Also would not recommend for anyone who has Seizure meds to take. This med has put me in many uneasy feelings. Not had any on floor events, but this med does not help. I have had almost every ""severe"" side effect from this medication. All on just 2 MG of medication once a day.    Sad I took this because it seems all diabetes meds only work for a short time and then are no longer useful to my system. Yeah for all of you who can take the cheap medication. Also I have gained 15 pounds in just 3 months time. Not looking forward to seeing how much more I gained in this past 3 months.    I also take this along with 1K metformin as well. I have tried so many different medications and had bad side effects that I am not sure where to go from here. May just need to look into more natural ways of controlling health.

My next goal is the exercise, so I'm sure the blood sugar will be leveled out a little more.

8293,Victoza Subcutaneous,4/7/2016,35-44,Female,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Other,5.0,5,5,5,"I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (POS) years ago. Last year, I was referred to a doctor that specializes in this disease; at the time I first met him, I weighed a whopping 387 pounds (I’m 5’10’’). Of course, the first thing he told me was that my POS would get better if I lost weight. I was totally discouraged! I told him that I was very active and had been on EVERY diet… nothing seemed to work. I was so frustrated and asked if there was anything he could do to jump start my weight loss from a medical stand point. This is when he told me about Victoza and about the study that demonstrated that individuals suffering from POS, not from Type 2 diabetes had lost weight on this medication but there were some serious side effects to consider. I was so desperate that after reading on the matter for a few days, I decided to try it out. The first months were pretty horrible because I had severe nausea and vomiting (in the morning upon waking I would throw up stomach acid – I know erk!) but I decided to continue. The reason I kept up with it is that, for the first time in my life, I could sense that I was full when I ate. For some reason, this message was not making its way up to my brain when I ate before… I thought it was awesome. The medication no only killed every craving I normally had but it stopped me from overeating. I have been on Victoza for one year now. The side effects are no longer there (they stopped after about 6 months after starting Victoza) and I now weigh 276 pounds… yes I lost over 100 pounds. I am continuing to lose weight and wish you all the best. Read More Read Less  "

Started Victoza and even before moving up to 1.28 dose, my numbers immediately dropped about 30 pts,and I lost about 7 lbs in first week. Only side effects were some minor nausea, and a couple days of diarrhea,but both passed after a week or so. The sugar control remains good (averaging about 110) but unfortunately the weight loss stopped. The dosages for my oral medications have dropped, and some may be eliminated. My medicare advantage plan only provides partial coverage (tier II drug)but the drug is worth it.

I heard some great things about victoza and some really bad things so I decided to try it out and hope for the best. Sad to say that I simply couldn't stand all the side effects that I encountered while on it. I felt like I was in a daze all the time and the nausea was really bad. I completely lost my appetite and after a week I started to throw up multiple times a day. I decided to stop because it simply made me sick to my stomach. I did some research on the internet to try and find something over the counter without side effects. I found this supplement called cinnalife which so far has been amazing for me. My A1C has significantly dropped which i'm sure is a large part due to the energy that this supplement gives me. I have been very active since I started taking them.

I was doing well at 7.0 but doctor changed me from Actors to few alternative drugs in the name of improving. Now I am on Trajenta and he recently increased the dosage and it has now shot up to staying above 12.5 on an average.  I don't this this is helping me at all.  
8335,Tradjenta Oral,7/14/2018,,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,After a two week trial my blood sugar readings were very good so it was used instead of taking insulin before each meal.  Once a day Trajenta and one shot of long lasting insulin and things are fine.

I'm almost surprised that I'm getting it as it's very expensive. However my glucose numbers have been way above normal lately. I guess that I wanted to believe that I could get away with being less strict with my diet. From what I can see this drug is not what I would call highly effective. You would be better off spending the money on a gym membership than this expensive ineffective medication, in my opinion. "

My levels do not seem to be going down. I have had some abdominal issues too. Concerned I am seeing my doctor this Friday for a follow up. Anyone else having the same problem? 
8342,Tradjenta Oral,1/13/2017,35-44,,less than 1 month,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1.0,1,1,1,I took this drug for a week and a half before fulling my prescription due to the 'few' potential side effects. I rarely have any but was sure that this was enough time for me to have started showing symptoms. I was very wrong. I had not met my deductible so I paid nearly $400 for the prescription. By the next day I had abdominal pain and within three days pancreatitis. I never even opened that bottle of pills. My doctor is another issue but I will NEVER take this medicine again.

In 2 years of taking this med 3 pens were unusable as to mixing of the two medicines required before injection.  Very poor quality control.  The injection site often would bleed and due to the watery consistancy of the bleeding which indicated sufficient amount of the medication was seeping back out and wasted.  Trulicity pen was so much better.  No more pain from the pen injections. No more mixing shaking to mix medication, and no more blood and medication seeping out from the injection site.

I was prescribed glucophage and Victors, then changed to Tanzeum because insurance would not pay for Victoza. Tanzeum was once a week so that was fine. Eventually with diet and exercise, I stopped the injection and was down to glucophage once a day. Then my blood sugar started creeping up so my meds changed to glipizide ER and Bydureon, which insurance would cover. After 7 weeks of injections, I had hard lumps and pea sized nodules at the injection sites. On the 7th week my abdomen swelled at the site and I was placed on antibiotics and also I was applying topical steroid cream to the inflamed area. I stopped the Bydureon and was placed on Ozembic, with an 8 week sample box. My blood sugar went down to 95. Great news except insurance wonâ??t pay again for the prescription. Iâ??m waiting for trulicity now. This has been such a stressful time for me. I am seeing a surgeon in 2 weeks but I donâ??t know what they can do about the nodules. I have reported this as an adverse reaction to Astra Zeneca as well as my pharmacist. I really hope these nodules and lumps eventually go away.

The delivery system is a failure.  It come in pens that come 4 to a pack with 5 needles.  At first I thought the 5th needle was a spare for some type of accident.  Not true at all.  You get the 5th needle because you are guaranteed to use it.  About 1 of 6 times your are going to have to change needles to get the medicine.  Sometimes you have to change the needle more than once.  This of course means multiple sticks for a single dose of medicine.  I can handle that, but it does get old.  The occasional nausea is again something that I can live with too.  The anal leakage, is another story.  This is a problem.  I hope that my body eventually adjusts.  I also hope that AstraZeneca hires somebody to actually fix their crappy delivery system.Read More Read Less  "

The lumps never go away either does the nausea both the day before and after treatment. About one out of eight syringes is not reliable. The injection site seems to leak after treatment. If you are prescribed this plan on an hour for treatment. Slow a half an hour after injection before moving around. I've found that leaving pressure on the injection site slows the leaking as the needle is quite large.

It does leave a purple spot on the injection site, and I do need to hold cotton over it because of the bleeding.  I notice that it gives me a definite euphoric high for several hours after injection! Not sure what THAT'S all about. And totally knocks out my appetite for a day or so.   But the withdrawal symptoms of BYDUREON are terrible: If I am late even by one day,  a sense of burning,  uncomfortable  prickly heat all over,  extremities especially,   and an awful dysthymia/depression sets in, I feel nearly suicidal and all I want to do is crawl into bed.  I think it is also giving me a foul-tasting belch,  all day long.  Until my next injection.   So this stuff is like a strange type of heroin  for me.

It's a clunky big syringe but I only use it once  week.  No problem with lumps; does ooze a bit after injections, but obviously most of the medication is getting in.   It dramatically reduces my appetite allowing me to eat 20% less, not feel deprived, and still feel energetic. In the past with caloric reduction,  my body has always gone into some sort of starvation energy conservation mode where I couldn't do much of anything.

I have been pleasantly surprised that the combination of weekly Bydureon along with daily Lantus and metformin have successfully controlled my 10  year Type 2 diabetes. The last A1c was 5.2 and me and the doctor are quite pleased.

The first time in the belly and the other attempts were in my thighs. I did not like the size or gauge of the needle It left a large hole were the medication would ooze back out. The plungers were terrible. I had to put so much pressure on the plungers that I thought the device was broken. The medication left these large lumps in my body that supposedly would go away a few weeks later, well here I am telling you that the lumps went down after 4 months after each injection. I don't think I had any of the nausea or other side effects but I did not see any beneficial results after taking the medication for seven weeks. The difficulty I had with the plungers and the lumps were enough for me to discontinue the shots and tell my Doctor to put me back on the Lantus, Novolog and Janumet regimen. Last but not least, here I am a year later and when ever I inject my current meds into the sites where I had the Bydureon lumps the area lumps up again. Bad experience for me.Read More Read Less  "

The only positive thing it did is suppress my appetite, which I welcomed as I was over eating. I weigh only 180 but still gaining.

This medicine is absolutely no joke. It comes with a black box warning. They also been cases of lawsuits against Merck for this product causing pancreatic cancer. I was on this medicine for three weeks. The very first three days I almost took myself into the hospital for lactic acidosis. I had immediate shortness of breath to where I almost couldn’t breathe, I had severe leg pain in my left leg, almost like I was super thirsty and my joints hurt like crazy. I tried to drink a lot of water but I felt like I couldn’t keep up with the gallon. I was drinking a day I didn’t even have your normal side effects that were headache etc.. My side effects were adverse reactions that included nausea in malaise. I woke up on the third day with immediate diarrhea and vomiting, and honestly felt like I had the flu. I stopped taking the med for two days and then I halfed the dose which seem to help. It did bring my blood sugars down as I would test in the morning after waking and then later in the afternoon. I completely changed my diet as clean as possible, even though I truly do eat as clean as I can, which would be the third week mark I felt like I was so dehydrated that I felt like I had the flu fever chills, nausea, diarrhea headache and then today I feel great but at this point I refuse to take this medicine I feel like my body is telling me that this is not a good medicine to take for me .

Dr. switch me to Janumet due to allergic reaction to various vendors version of Generic Metformin.  The only side effects were: on occasion would get diarrhea and constipation at the same time, weight gain, slight fatigue and once every month my joints would (very crippling) ache from my toes to my head. I was using Generic Metformin for several years and was starting to show progress which included weight loss and stable blood sugar levels until a vendor was bought out by another vendor then the next refill of generic  Metformin from this new vendor began to emit an odor of rotting dead fish.   This stinky version of Metformin caused several side effects: Constipation, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, shakes, blood sugar spikes, sweats, shivers, memory loss, heart palpitation,  blurry vision, abdominal pain, insatiable hunger for sweets, fits of rage, rashes, hives, migraines that would lead to bloody nose and a state of catatonia. Reported it to FDA after trying several different generic vendors and coming up with the same stinky Metformin, but they never replied to my complaint. That's when the Dr. switch me to Janumet at $140 a refill when I just needed a good source of $11 a refill Metformin.

I am also on Invokana and Glipizide and without the Victoza my sugars were in the 180s-200s fasting.  Also, for those dreading the needle, it is tiny.  I felt only one of the three needle sticks so far and the one I did feel was much less painful than sticking my finger to check my blood sugar, which I do multiple times a day.

After 10 years on Metformin, I realized that my glucose levels were steadily increasing even when my doctor had increased the dosage to 500 mg three times a day.  Finally, in March 2023, I expressed my frustration to my doctor and she decided to add Farxiga 10mg to my daily regimen.  What a difference this has made!  My fasting levels went from 170 to 98 within a month.  I've already lost three pounds in one month.  One change I made that helped was that I started taking my Farxiga pill after dinner, instead of in the mornings, as recommended.  This resulted in lower glucose readings.  Since my largest meal of the day is during dinner, I figured that I would take the pill with the meal that was highest in carbs.  Works for me.  Since taking Farxiga, my glucose readings during the day no longer surpass 200 mg/dl.  Prior to taking Farxiga, they were between 200--300 mg/dl, so this new medication has made all the difference.  So far, so good ?? Read More Read Less  "

In May my A1C was 6.9 and in August A1C was 6.6.  I have lost between 5-6 pounds and my triglycerides went from 176 to 131. I would recommend this medication, but it is very important to drink PLENTY of water, to practice good hygiene and to avoid sugar as much as possible."

I started out in the morning with a reading of 106, noon was 155 and 187 at dinner time.  Plus started having back pain and leg pain.  This has to be the worse drug I have EVER tried.

Very, very weak all over, muscle pain all over but especially in the lower back-- so bad I could barely walk or stand up. UTI came next along with upset stomach, dizziness, dry mouth, kidney area pain, frequent urination but with very little urine despite drinking 48 to 64 ounces of water each day (plus coffee and iced tea). Felt dazed at times. Blood sugars ranged from 174 to 274 while on the drug, average being 223. Prior to taking the drug, the average was 220. To top it all off, the cost is insane for this retiree-- $120 a pop!

I am not overly impressed with this product.  Based on my daily glucose readings, I'm not seeing any big improvements in my numbers, they have remained pretty much the same but the worst thing about this drug is the injection method.  
For the last two injections I've experienced nothing but problems with the injectors, I have pushed the trigger and the button will not go down.  I'd hold that button down for several minutes and still nothing happened, no matter how much pressure I applied.  Oh, I'd hear the first click but never the second.  So when I'd remove the injector from my skin, I could see that no medicine had been released so I'd try again, and still nothing.  The trigger would not go down.  After the second try, after I'd removed it from the injection site and pushed the trigger the stupid thing would start to work and I'd lose the entire dose.  What a piece of junk!  I've tried with it being cold from the refrigerator and also letting it warm up a bit and still have been unsuccessful in getting a dose of medicine.  Also, I do have to say those loud clicks are disturbing and startle me every time.  I'll be so glad when I run through these doses, (if I ever manage to use them) so I can get back on Ozempic.

Although it was great in managing my sugars and aided in needed weightloss (alongside calorie deficit), it kept me exhausted throughout the day and a few months into taking the medication sent me in a downward depression spiral. I'd had never been through a depression episode this long in my life. Although I admit I was stressed, I was unusually tired after coming home from school (much more than normal), couldn't focus on schoolwork at all due to headaches and I wanted to cry spontaneously after any possible poor experience (e.g overheating). I know this to be true because as soon as I spoke to my doctor and went off it for 3 days, I had much more energy in the evening, felt much more in control and was happier/more focused. Bottom line, do try this medicine and it may work for you (1000mg)! However, if you may be in a situation where you may have to cope with lots of responsibilities and/or stress, it may be best to lay off it.Read More Read Less  "

It wasn't racing, more like a labored beating.  I began to feel like my upper body was being squeezed and had spells where I felt like it was hard to get my breath.

My primary doctor sent me to an endocrinologist who took me off of Glimiperide and put me on Glyxambi. I lost 32 lbs and my A1c dropped to 6.0 (with medications).

I was originally put on insulin and metformin. My GP who followed up with me switched the metformin to Synjardy along with continued insulin. My A1C at that time was 12. Initially, the way the Synjardy Rx directions on the label read, I was taking 2 capsules in the morning. I experienced great GI issues and I believe dehydration by taking 2 capsules together. I had lost 25 pds in one week when I was hospitalized and I continued to drop weight because I couldn't eat any real solid food due to the GI problems. I decided to to take one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening to see if that would have an effect. What a change that was for me. My GI issues got better, I was able to eat better (in addition in to having to eat more healthier because of the diabetes Dx). I Believe the Synjardy improved my insulin sensitivity too because after 3 months, I worked myself off from requiring insulin injections as my average daily blood sugars were 103. I now just use the Synjardy. My first 3 month A1C score was 6. I am 35 pounds lighter than what I was 4 months ago and I am guessing that also helps the bigger health picture for me.Read More Read Less  "

After about 2 more months my A1C dropped to 6.5. So far it has worked great and I have maintained below a 7.0 A1C now for approximately a year. I have also loss weight with the medication.

By then I've been taking it almost 2 years and couldn't figure out that the small actos pill was really messing up my health,  my hair started falling out and it actually got pretty thin when I read that article, and told the doctor i'm stopping taking it.  Next thing you know, my stomach started getting better, my hair stopped falling out in bunches and did grow back a little, I still have a lot of hair loss, but at least i'm not bald.  This small pill caused my whole system to be out of whack, so not really sure what it was doing to me.  But if you have any of these symptoms, stop, it's only going to lead to something bad.Read More Read Less  "

8682,Actos Oral,10/5/2014,55-64,Female,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1.7,1,3,1,"I was on Actos for 5 years.  Unbelievably, my doc put me on it only 6 months after I had a heart attack, in spite of the warnings about cardiac side effects.  It did keep my A1C down below 7, taken with metformin and glimiperide.  But I have suffered severe, debilitating leg and muscle pain.  But I never made the connection to Actos; I thought it was related to neuropathy and problems with my spine.  In May of this year my A1C was creeping up above 7, so my doc told me to increase my Actos dose to 45 mg from 30.  Within a month I became short of breath and had crackling sounds in my lungs when I breathed.  I just thought I had bronchitis and waited it out.  I also had terrible swelling in my ankles and feet, and then I broke a toe, too.  In Sept I was to return to the doctor and the night before, I began to wonder if the Actos could be causing the swelling.  Sure enough...I read all the warnings, and realized that I was well on my way to congestive heart failure!!!  I stopped taking Actos that morning.  Much of the swelling has gone down.  And my legs stopped hurting!!!  This drug has made my life hell for 5 years.Read More Read Less  "

It is important that you take the time to read the reviews of those who suffered serious harm from Actos, and remember that many people have died too.  Do they make these drugs in China, or are they an oversight from the FDA?  Who today would feed their dogs the killing treats made in China?

Even though he had told her that her heart was fine, she had a heart attack within a week of taking the drug and died. He should have paid more attention to her.

I have been able to change my life without surgery, I can move around better, have less pain, and finally feel like I can get back to the me I want to be!

(Yes, I was literally in junior high, and high school in the late 80's to early 90's! Hahaha!) I've gone from size 16 down to a size 11 now.

Just from the fasting (no food from 9p-9a), not eating potatoes and minimizing my bread intake I lost 20 lbs.  In the six months since taking Rybelsus I have lost another 10 lbs.  Rybelsus does seem to help me with feeling hungry less often.  However, it has also caused me several bouts - about once a month - with cramping or constipation/diarrhea.  My tips...taking the pill is easier than an injection but not by much considering how bitter it is (and if it gets stuck in your mouth or throat for any reason you'll regret it).  I also found that I had to avoid any greasy/oily/spicy foods as those seemed to bring on the cramping/upset stomach issues much faster.  Now having my A1C much lower (due to the diet change/weight loss) I'll be stopping Rybelsus soon.  It's just not worth the impact (gastroparesis) that it is having on my digestive system, in my opinion.  It wasn't a terrible medicine most of the time, but if you do experience the side effects they can be considerable.Read More Read Less  "

I have lost about 32 pounds.  I have had some light headedness and nausea.  I was also taking Metformin and my doctor advised me to stop the Metformin since my concern was the light headedness.  Since stopping that, I very occasionally have some light headedness but not like I was with both Rybelsus and Metformin. Some constipation and diarrhea.  Not overly bothersome for me.  I have not noticed a metallic taste or anything like that.  If I feel nauseous I drink a little water or eat a little something and that helps.  I asked my doctor to keep me on the 3 mg because I tolerated it well and it did what it was supposed to do.  My appetite has decreased and I don't have the sugary cravings as often, rarely in fact.  I crave fruits more than anything on this.  I am nervous about long term effects reading all of the reviews posted.  Another reason I have asked to stay on the 3 mg.  I will see my doctor again next month to review more lab work.  This medication has been successful for me but there are a few side effects I deal with as mentioned above.

I eat less, slower, low fat and very few sweets. Letting your body digest your food and not over eat is key. And I play a lot of pickle ball. I have had no side effects, and my A1C last check was 6.

That was my no more moment. Yes I lost weight, mostly because I couldn't eat without feeling sick, yes my a1c came down, but the bad effects are not worth it.

I've been about 45 pounds overweight for over a year and it's been really difficult for me to lose. In seven days, I've already lost six pounds! 
There are some side effects which aren't that great, but I'm losing weight so fast, I don't even care. I'm mildly nauseous often and it's not a fun feeling, but the queasiness is manageable. Also, I am only able to eat a fraction of a full plate before feeling very full. I can't eat another bite after only enjoying 1/4 of what I normally consume. My bowel movements have dramatically slowed down to every other day or so, but I'm eating so little now, my stomach has actually become flat. The constipation doesn't bother me very much.

I moved from a 3mg to a 7mg in four days and then to the top 14mg.  I lost 23lbs after 2 months and never had any problems except extreme constipation (you just intake more fiber to counteract this). The key is little-to-NO sugar, fat and VERY LOW carbs.  You can consumer carbs but if you keep daily consumption under 15 (just like with Keto or Paleo), your weight will drop significantly, quickly!  I am on a second round after seeing if I could hold my own weight without it for several months and I only gained 5 pounds.

I guess I am lucky--I have had no side effects other than constipation. I had to start taking MiraLax daily which solved this issue.  I have been on it for 5 months and have lost 24 pounds. It isn't a miracle weight loss drug.  It just curbs hunger pains and makes you feel full faster, so you eat much less.  I have also found it helps with cravings--sweets and fried foods are not as tempting. it's odd, I just don't want them much any more. I do feel better over all and walk daily now.

Side effects didn't hit me until 7.5 and 10 mg doses. Constipation hit me hard at 10mg. Glucose numbers run in the 90s fasting. Happy with glucose readings. Not much weight loss. At 10mg I began having freezing cold toes, hands, and nose throughout the day even when weather is 80 degrees outside.

8782,Mounjaro Subcutaneous,3/27/2024,45-54,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,5.0,5,5,5,"I'll start with this, right at the beginning of Covid, I was 145 lbs and probably 5% body fat. I was quite literally in the best shape of my life at 46 years old. Then like a flash, Covid hits and we go into lock down. If I am not active, I get really bad about eating. I mean really bad. Entire ice cream cakes multiple times a week, chips, cookies, candy.....you get the gist. Mostly it's from boredom but it quickly turns into an addictive habit to mask my own personal struggles. (never fully recovered 9/11 survivor and recovering Alcoholic.) I don't drink (haven't in nearly 20 years), don't smoke and somehow, in 1 year, my weight climbed to 195 lbs. How did I eat myself to that weight? Especially since I am only 5'6"". What a nightmare I got myself into....again. I somehow let this crazy eating cycle continue until I reached an absolute breaking point. Bottom if you may. I made a decision to commit to a new me, a healthy me and one that will be around for my daughter for a long time. I started Mounjaro 3 weeks ago when I weighed in at 194 lbs in my doctor's office, switched to a fully plant based diet, cut out ALL sugar, eliminated processed foods and I am exercising religiously. My weight as of the typing of this review is 176 lbs. My goal is to get back to the 145-150 range and hopefully ween off of the medication if I can. Fingers crossed. For anyone who is reading this that is struggling, I hope you hear my message as one of support because I know how easy it is to mask life's issues with food.  I have spent my entire life losing weight, gaining it back and adding a little extra. I just got sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I know my weight loss is not a ton, but at the end of the day, we are all looking to accomplish the same thing. Know that you are worth the effort to me, friends, family, neighbors, kids, etc. You can lose the weight and be a new you.  Just stay committed to making a mindset shift and don't view this as a ""diet"". View this as a positive lifestyle change that will keep you planted on the earth for a long time and not planted in it before it's your time. I could not be happier and I know you will as well. Just be patient and let the universe drive during this journey.Read More Read Less  "

In 2 months A1C moved from 6.5 to 4.1. Started on 2.5mg for 3 months, 5 mg for 3 months and now 7.5. My current weight 160 and my goal is 144. Mounjaro is controlling A1C, reducing sugar cravings, and make portion control easy for me. I no longer use metformin or Jardience. Once I stay at goal weight for 3+ months, I plan to have a breast reduction and lift (no implants) to complement my healthier body. My body has experienced less inflammation as arthritis, headaches and fibromyalgia are improved by better food choices and higher activity resulting in weight loss. Mounjaro is an excellent tool for people with weight challenge, reducing A1C and reducing cardiovascular risks. I am so thankful for this!Read More Read Less  "

I started taking the 2.5mg dosage exactly 1 month ago for type 2 diabetes and obesity. When I started, I weighed 291lbs, and today's I weigh 270---that's an incredible 21lb weight loss in just one month!!!! Now, I did start eating healthy and exercising at the same time; but I truly believe I could not have done this w/o the Mounjaro. In the past, my biggest problem was that I was a binge-eater: eating whatever I was craving for in very large quantities. But the immediate effects I noticed with this AMAZING MED is that it took all my cravings away; and I actually don't really think about food at all. I hardly ever need to eat more than 1,500 calories per day. The only side-effect that I did notice was that I was generally tired in the 1st week after taking it; but my body has adjusted and I'm good now. For the first time in over 17 yrs, I truly believe that Mounjaro will help me get to my goal weight of 178.

It could be a reaction to Levaquin too, so I will try it again in a couple of weeks.  Levequin caused severe tendonitis.  I also take 3,000 mg of calcium and 10,000 units of vitamin D3. I used to have severe cramps for years before starting Acarbose, then felt better on it, then started the calcium and felt better for a year.  It is hard to get this all straightened our.

With proper diet and exercise, it is quite an reliable medication.  It did cause diarrhea, but that side effect only lasted until my body was familiar with the medication.  In my case, the diarrhea lasted for a week or so - off and on . . . not every day.  From my initial blood sugar of 380, I am now able to maintain the levels between 80 and 150.

The results were unfavorable. Now I am not afraid to check my diabetes since the reading is where I wanted it. Great pill. I am so pleased. Now, Health First told me that they do not cover that pill. and so I discussed it with my doctor. If I have to scrape the last penny to buy it, I will keep on using this pill.Read More Read Less  "

I had severe upset stomach when taking generic metformin so my doctor switched me to Fortamet ER. Although it is the same drug as metformin, the extended release tablet helps with digestive problems by not dumping so much medication into your system at once. The MOST important thing to know about taking any metformin drug is to eat LOTS of protein when you take the pills and throughout the day. My doctor even recommended drinking a protein shake, which has about 23g of protein, with the medicine. Doing this stopped any stomach upset I was having. The other key to avoiding side effects is to build up slowly to your ideal dose.Read More Read Less  "

I had gained a huge amount of weight, from 220 up to 317. my diabetes was out of control. all I wanted to do was eat sweets and sleep. After starting the byetta, it was about 3 weeks, I started to notice weight loss. I gradually lost my desire to eat sweets all the time, and started staying awake more and more, I felt much better but still had to keep an eye on my sugar levels. Within 6 months I had gone down in weight from the 317 to 212 and then lost a little more gradually ending up at 205, a weight that both I and my Doctor was happy with. But within the next 6 to 8 months I started craving sweets again and gradually putting on weight. I am now at 235, wich is still on the good side. at least its not 317. He started me on a new shot called xxxxxxx that also has the same possible side effects, but has started helping me get back on the right track again. My sugar is pretty much under control,and I am losing weight again, but dont expect the medication alone to do it for you. a lot of work goes into taking care of yourself when you are diabetic. Do a lot of reasearch, ask your doctor questions you need answers to, But make sure you keep up with diet and exercise. Its hard at first but you will get use to it.Good LuckRead More Read Less  "
9060,Byetta Subcutaneous,1/1/2013,,Female,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Additional Medication for Diabetes Type 2,4.3,5,4,4,"Given Byetta when Metformin stopped being enough.  Terrible nausea for 2 weeks, some nausea always.  Took for 5 years, doc switched me to Victoza, which was awful as it gave me sewer mouth.  Back to Byetta.  One known side effect not often mentioned was that the Byetta threw me back to fertile stage of life after having gone through menopause.  So had to go through that again. Oh, yea!  Worst thing was having to take it with me to work for dinner, and then forgetting to take it home. Lost 30 pounds in first 4 months, then nothing.  That was probably due to being unable to eat after dinner from the nausea.  Got me into the habit of not eating after dinner though! Yea!  Expensive, but insurance company didn't hassle me about it like they did with less expensive Victoza.  Would have lots of tiredness when stressed, but that may have been just the stress.  General health improved.  Love the drug; glad to be back on Byetta. Second time around bad nausea only 3-4 days. It seems like Byetta slows down the digestion later in the process than in the stomach so didn't have the rotting contents syndrome that Victoza gave me (belching; sewer mouth).  Sucking salty items like olives and dill pickle slices controlled the nausea.Read More Read Less  "

9069,Actoplus MET Oral,8/21/2015,55-64,Female,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.0,3,2,1,"I had been taking this drug for more than 5 years. Last year Januvia was added, because the Actosplus Met was insufficient to adequately lower my blood sugar. For the entire time, I have been unable to lose weight, although my daily calorie consumption is about 1000. I've had extreme fatigue, aches and pains, urinary urgency, carb cravings, and diarrhea. 2 weeks ago I reported to my doctor that my FBG was over 250. He replaced the Januvia with Farxiga. He also sent me to get a cardiac CT scan due to my family history. Since the dye used in the test, combined with metformin can cause lactic acidosis, I couldn't take my Actosplus Met for 2 days. By the second day, I felt great. My FBG was under 170 using just the Farxiga. My aches and pains went away, and the weight just started dropping off. 15 days later, I have lost 11 lbs, my FBG is under 150, I am no longer retaining fluid, and I feel 10 times better. This is only my experience, but there is no way I am ever taking this drug again. I can't believe I've spent 5 years wondering why I couldn't lose weight, no matter how little I ate. A diabetes drug with these side effects should never have been approved by the FDA. Its existence is some kind of cosmic joke on diabetics. I don't know if the drug manufacturer is negligent or inept. A diabetes drug that causes weight gain and aches and pains bad enough to prevent exercise would certainly ensure people have to keep taking it. I have hope that without this drug that I can keep losing weight through diet and exercise and that my numbers will continue to improve. I believe that CT scan may have saved my life, although not in the way it was intended. Your experience may be completely different than mine, but if you are suffering from these side effects, see your doctor. If he or she dismisses your concerns, find another doctor. It's your life, after all.Read More Read Less  "

9076,Actoplus MET Oral,8/9/2011,55-64,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.3,1,5,1,"This was a terrible drug and I regret allowing my Dr. to switch me from Metformin (which worked extremely well for me)to ActoplusMet 15/500.    1.)It did NOT control my blood sugar nearly as well as Metformin and my A1c number crept up gradually over the 4 years I was on it, from 5.6 to 6.9.  2.) I gained over 35 pounds in spite of consistent exercise and a pretty darn good dietary regimen.  3.) I began to be suspicious of the early signs of congestive heart failure and possible coronary artery disease which was confirmed by a recent stress EKG and subsequent angiogram.    These problems all took place in spite of good cholesterol numbers in the 135 - 145 range and LDL numbers below 70.   I insisted my doctor take me off Actoplus and went back to plain Metformin about 7 months ago and since then have dropped almost 25 pounds. I'm also seeing huge improvements in my blood glucose readings.  I am absolutely convinced that I got off Actoplus in the nick of time to avoid needing full-blown open heart surgery (at least for now) and am attempting to deal with the CAD with aggressive heart medications, continued exercise and diet ... we'll see over the next year whether or not this works.    Unfotunately there's no way to prove one way or the other that Actoplus is the culprit with resect to the heart issues, but I'm a student of my own body and I'm thoroughly convinced it's the primary cause. The added fact that it did a terrible job controlling my blood sugar, which was the sole reason for taking it in the first place makes it a failed experiment as far as I'm concerned.  It may work for others but it was a disaster for me.  Read More Read Less  "
