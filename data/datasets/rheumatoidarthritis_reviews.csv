I went on Azathioprine to keep my condition in check 8 years ago.  I picked it over Humira, Remicade and Entyvio because the side effects from Azathioprine are supposed to be less.  So far, so good. My only symptom is an occasional mild pain around where I was resectioned. I feel no side effects taking 100mg/day. It is important to get a blood test every 3 months to watch for lymphoma.

Every day more vomiting about half an hour after taking the pill, and then blood in my urine (UTI) never had that problem in my life, also started having fluid in my ear and ear canal infection. I quit the medicine and 2 weeks later I still can't go out in the sun and am having more infections. I believe this medicine also caused my hep C treatment to fail (Mavyret). The Dr told me to take both medicines concurrently. Big mistake. I haven't been the same since I took azathioprine. I just hope I recover my immune system at some point.

I went on Azathioprine to keep my condition in check 8 years ago.  I picked it over Humira, Remicade and Entyvio because the side effects from Azathioprine are supposed to be less.  So far, so good. My only symptom is an occasional mild pain around where I was resectioned. I feel no side effects taking 100mg/day. It is important to get a blood test every 3 months to watch for lymphoma.

I went on Azathioprine to keep my condition in check 8 years ago.  I picked it over Humira, Remicade and Entyvio because the side effects from Azathioprine are supposed to be less.  So far, so good. My only symptom is an occasional mild pain around where I was resectioned. I feel no side effects taking 100mg/day. It is important to get a blood test every 3 months to watch for lymphoma.

Next came Rituxan and even though I felt so much better on Rituxan my rheumatologist though my inflammatory numbers were staying way to high. He switched me to actemra. Right away this med made me feel awful. Non stop headache for 10-14 days following infusion, doubling over stomach pains, my blood pressure literally went so high 230/136 range and my feet and ankles swelled terrible. Then came my blood work and it was the worst ever. Even worse than when I was first diagnosed. He stopped the actemra right away after a few infusions. I am back on the combination of mtx injections, Rituxan infusions, gabapentin and celebrex. This is a good combination for me and I’m probably as good as I can get.

Then I started Actemra which dramatically reduced inflammation from 90% down to single digits. I could kneel again, take long walks, stand in line, etc. I got my life back. It's been two years now and, unfortunately, the side effects are increasing. Fatigue is significant in that I haven't been able to work due to exhaustion resulting in illness, I developed mouth sores, as well as the usual increased sensitivity to airborne illnesses. I've had shingles and continue to experience rib pain from the latent virus. I'm now in bed with mumps! We will be switching meds this month. So I'm ambivalent.

Next came Rituxan and even though I felt so much better on Rituxan my rheumatologist though my inflammatory numbers were staying way to high. He switched me to actemra. Right away this med made me feel awful. Non stop headache for 10-14 days following infusion, doubling over stomach pains, my blood pressure literally went so high 230/136 range and my feet and ankles swelled terrible. Then came my blood work and it was the worst ever. Even worse than when I was first diagnosed. He stopped the actemra right away after a few infusions. I am back on the combination of mtx injections, Rituxan infusions, gabapentin and celebrex. This is a good combination for me and I’m probably as good as I can get.

It's been two years now and, unfortunately, the side effects are increasing. Fatigue is significant in that I haven't been able to work due to exhaustion resulting in illness, I developed mouth sores, as well as the usual increased sensitivity to airborne illnesses. I've had shingles and continue to experience rib pain from the latent virus. I'm now in bed with mumps! We will be switching meds this month. So I'm ambivalent.

I have consistently been on methotrexate for many years, with first enbrel that I failed after 6 years. Then on to remicade infusions which I also failed. Next came Rituxan and even though I felt so much better on Rituxan my rheumatologist though my inflammatory numbers were staying way to high. He switched me to actemra. Right away this med made me feel awful. Non stop headache for 10-14 days following infusion, doubling over stomach pains, my blood pressure literally went so high 230/136 range and my feet and ankles swelled terrible. Then came my blood work and it was the worst ever. Even worse than when I was first diagnosed. He stopped the actemra right away after a few infusions. I am back on the combination of mtx injections, Rituxan infusions, gabapentin and celebrex. This is a good combination for me and I’m probably as good as I can get.

It's been two years now and, unfortunately, the side effects are increasing. Fatigue is significant in that I haven't been able to work due to exhaustion resulting in illness, I developed mouth sores, as well as the usual increased sensitivity to airborne illnesses. I've had shingles and continue to experience rib pain from the latent virus. I'm now in bed with mumps! We will be switching meds this month. So I'm ambivalent.

The urgent care doctor wrote it off as possible tendon/muscle pain.. I will follow up with my PCP but at the moment I am happy because the pain has subsided a bit from this one injection. The injection itself in my buttocks muscle on opposite side did not really feel like anything at first and then it burned and felt painful to the touch at the injection site.. it subsided after about 30 minutes. and the onset for my pain to start going away was about 2 hours or so... it was not instant.. The down side is that I have a CRAP ton of energy and I am sitting here typing this up.. LOL... BUT I did not need any OPIOIDS for my pain... and that right there is AWESOME!

I feel like I've been sicker on Cimzia than any other of my biologic medicines and I've been on 3 over the past 9 years or so. The respiratory infections alone are reason for me to want to go off this, but my doctor said I had to give it 6 months.  Will see what the verdict is in a couple of weeks. Read More Read Less  "

Interestingly it has also seems to virtually eliminated the mild BPH symptoms that I was experiencing before starting the drug. I would expect a bump in my cholesterol (next blood work will be in a week or two) but this is a known side effect that can be managed with statins if required.

I also suffered some horrible heartburn/reflux, but Pepcid to the rescue for the win! I started taking 20 mg three months after being on 10 mg. Everything was pretty much the same until Christmas Day…that’s when the diarrhea started, and it still hasn’t stopped after 2 weeks. I spend more time on the toilet than I do anywhere else, and I’m exhausted. I did stop taking leflunomide almost a week ago, but this diarrhea is practically nonstop. I take Zofran and Imodium, and I eat 5-10 crackers a day (if I’m lucky), but it exits just as quickly as it entered. My rheumatologist prescribed colestipol, which I just started taking yesterday. I’m crossing my fingers that it helps because I don’t know what else to do.

My PCP and rheumatologist are both telling me that if the diarrhea continues, I should see a GI…why would I do that when I know what’s causing it?! It’s frustrating that the doctors seem to not want to acknowledge the horrible side effects from this medicine. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy, but I wonder how doctors would handle it if they had to experience what we are ??Read More Read Less  "

His RA doctor said this was caused by the Leflunomide.  They tried to flush it out of his system but that didn't work.  His immune system was so weakened that sepsis was able to gain hold.  In the end he died from severe septic shock and pneumonia (in a matter of 5 hours).  Stay away from this medication!  The warnings say it can be fatal and they are correct.  The RA doctor didn't seem surprised that my husband (who was otherwise very healthy) died.  What the heck??  I'm sure his RA doctor is continuing to prescribe Leflunomide.  My husband wasn't just ""an unusual case"".  He golfed twice a week and went to the gym twice a week until the Leflunomide became so toxic that it attacked his bone marrow and shut down his systems.

During the 3 years, he was first put on Methotrexate.  When that didn't seem to work anymore his RA doctor switched him to Cimzia.

His RA doctor said this was caused by the Leflunomide.  They tried to flush it out of his system but that didn't work.  His immune system was so weakened that sepsis was able to gain hold.  In the end he died from severe septic shock and pneumonia (in a matter of 5 hours).  Stay away from this medication!  The warnings say it can be fatal and they are correct.

My husband wasn't just ""an unusual case"".  He golfed twice a week and went to the gym twice a week until the Leflunomide became so toxic that it attacked his bone marrow and shut down his systems.

Not quite as good as Vioxx was, but one 200mg cap lets me sleep at night. I sometimes take a 100mg during the day if I am doing something strenuous (shoulders act up). Zero side effects. Amazing.

I have been cutting up big trees from some recent storms (10 hour days with a chainsaw) and I had to take 200mg during those days. Before I started Celebrex, I couldn't even pick up my saw without pain.I just completed 4 days of cutting (and I did a total of 7 days last month).

It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

Not quite as good as Vioxx was, but one 200mg cap lets me sleep at night. I sometimes take a 100mg during the day if I am doing something strenuous (shoulders act up). Zero side effects. Amazing.

I have been cutting up big trees from some recent storms (10 hour days with a chainsaw) and I had to take 200mg during those days. Before I started Celebrex, I couldn't even pick up my saw without pain.I just completed 4 days of cutting (and I did a total of 7 days last month).

It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

This page didn't offer enough choices. I have chronic neck and shoulder pain from old injuries. Can't sleep for the pain. 

I was taking Vioxx before it was discontinued (best treatment I ever had), then they put me on Naprosyn - which worked but is very hard on the stomach. Switched to Celebrex. Not quite as good as Vioxx was, but one 200mg cap lets me sleep at night. I sometimes take a 100mg during the day if I am doing something strenuous (shoulders act up). Zero side effects. Amazing.

I have been cutting up big trees from some recent storms (10 hour days with a chainsaw) and I had to take 200mg during those days. Before I started Celebrex, I couldn't even pick up my saw without pain.I just completed 4 days of cutting (and I did a total of 7 days last month).

However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.  It's not quite as effective on the pain and stiffness but at least I can still function.  If you don't have nasty side-effects from Celebrex, it's a game changer for those with arthritic pain!

It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

This page didn't offer enough choices. I have chronic neck and shoulder pain from old injuries. Can't sleep for the pain. 

I was taking Vioxx before it was discontinued (best treatment I ever had), then they put me on Naprosyn - which worked but is very hard on the stomach. Switched to Celebrex. Not quite as good as Vioxx was, but one 200mg cap lets me sleep at night. I sometimes take a 100mg during the day if I am doing something strenuous (shoulders act up). Zero side effects. Amazing.

I have been cutting up big trees from some recent storms (10 hour days with a chainsaw) and I had to take 200mg during those days. Before I started Celebrex, I couldn't even pick up my saw without pain.I just completed 4 days of cutting (and I did a total of 7 days last month).

It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.

I was on 200mg Celecoxib (generic of Celebrex) for about 6 weeks.  On the first day, within 6 hours of taking it, I was essentially pain free.  It was amazing, and continued to relieve the pain to a high degree.  However, I had terrible gas and flatulence along with bloating and heartburn as side effects; the kind of flatulence that you can't even remotely conceal!  I got some OTC anti-gas medication and it helped a little, but not enough. Ultimately, the gas was giving me an even worse quality of life than the pain because I didn't want to be around people due to not being able to control the flatulence.  I stopped taking it and the bloating has gone away, as has the flatulence and gas. I take 200-400mg of Ibuprofen now, instead.  It's not quite as effective on the pain and stiffness but at least I can still function.  If you don't have nasty side-effects from Celebrex, it's a game changer for those with arthritic pain!

I was taking Vioxx before it was discontinued (best treatment I ever had), then they put me on Naprosyn - which worked but is very hard on the stomach. Switched to Celebrex. Not quite as good as Vioxx was, but one 200mg cap lets me sleep at night. I sometimes take a 100mg during the day if I am doing something strenuous (shoulders act up). Zero side effects. Amazing.

I have been cutting up big trees from some recent storms (10 hour days with a chainsaw) and I had to take 200mg during those days. Before I started Celebrex, I couldn't even pick up my saw without pain.I just completed 4 days of cutting (and I did a total of 7 days last month).

The physical and psychological effects of this are almost intolerable. 
My dermatologist prescribed me rinvoq 15 soon after it was approved in Canada… and I could get some financial help. 

Within a week my skin cleared 75%!!!!!the pain and itch greatly subsided

My initial dose was 90 mg/day!  Try weaning from that dose!  I was (after many, many incorrect diagnoses) finally diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis.  It has taken two years of my life.  Prednisone is a vile and evil drug.  I have been through hell with muscle pain, writhing on the sofa, still taking morphine to even appear to be somewhat ""normal"", to shower, walk, breathe, raise my head from my pillow.  The simple things.  My face swelled so much that my eyes were slits, barely able to do their job.  I spent almost a year in bed.  Missing all holidays, birthdays, family, friends...  Was there a choice?  No.  Did I have good doctors to support me?  Yes.  Was it my Rheumatologist?  No.  Was it my Primary Care Dr. who prescribed the 90 mg then no longer wanted to see me? No. It was the love of my life,  my Oncologist!  Yes!  He was by my side and saw me through every ugly event.  And there were soooo many!  I was also fortunate to have skipped over the mental side effects.  I didn't chase my husband with a skillet, threatening to kill him as my girlfriend did.  I did keep a good sense of humor.  My Neurologist (found about a year too late) has helped me through a lot of the pain in each and every muscle in my body and my head.  Topomax was a huge success in that area.  It helped to alleviate some of my 700+ day headache and also was effective in helping me loose some of the weight I have gained from Prednisone.  So, I guess there is hope.  I'm alive, I don't suffer from debilitating headaches, and I'm not blind.  I'm unsure of the status of my muscles, tendons and ligaments, bones, teeth, etc.  We'll see in the next year or so when, hopefully, this nightmare is over.

I've been prescribed it when my asthma gets really severe. I've never taken it for more than 2 weeks at a time. I've always been very happy with the results. One of the side effects that I like is that my 60-year-old body has fewer aches and pains while I'm taking it. I'm on my second day of a 5-day treatment and already my breathing is improving. Because of scarring on my lungs via acid reflux I had a doctor want to put me on this med for a year and a half.

It took more than 10 years of disease activity before I gave in and finally took it. My doctor has prescribed it before, but prior to this year, I had never even filled the prescriptions.    I wish I wouldn't have given in. I thought maybe I was blowing the risks out of proportion, as my GI doctor has told me numerous time that I was overreacting, and that the drug was the safest of any.    Prior to being treated with prednisone, I had suffered through my symptoms, or taken medication that only controlled my symptoms.  I was much happier with both of those options, as miserable as the disease can be. I wasn't depressed before, now I am. I've been off of the steroids a month now, and I still have menstrual bleeding that started 3 months ago when the prednisone was started. It has been nonstop. My doctor said it would stop, and that it was nothing to worry about. Maybe she doesn't feel like having a relationship with her husband, I desperately want one with mine.      My skin is now very oily and I have terrible acne. I was told this would go away, but it's getting worse. My vision is blurry still, my eyes are dry and red, and they feel like they are filled with sand. I was told this was caused by my disease, not the drug. My eye doctor disagrees.      I was unable to sleep much despite being physically drained the entire time while on the medication. It was awful. Anti-anxiety medications didn't help. I also started having trouble with weakness after starting the medication. It was terrible. I could barely walk to my bedroom.    My advice, if your gut feeling is to run from this drug, run, and run fast. I had far less trouble with being on, and coming off of pain medication that I took to control the symptoms of my disease. They said those weren't safe, but I had no ill effects during or after treatment. They should be more cautious in prescribing this this as they are with pain medication.Read More Read Less  "

When I am taking Prednisone my Crohn's symptoms are gone, I can walk and stand for an increased amount of time.  When I am not on this drug I have diarrhea 10 times a day and I can walk or stand for a maximum of 20-30 seconds.  I find it ironic that I am on Remicade infusions which cost $5000 each time (every 2 months) which do nothing for me but 20 mg of prednisone daily give me my life back.

My initial dose was 90 mg/day!  Try weaning from that dose!  I was (after many, many incorrect diagnoses) finally diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis.  It has taken two years of my life.  Prednisone is a vile and evil drug.  I have been through hell with muscle pain, writhing on the sofa, still taking morphine to even appear to be somewhat ""normal"", to shower, walk, breathe, raise my head from my pillow.  The simple things.  My face swelled so much that my eyes were slits, barely able to do their job.  I spent almost a year in bed.  Missing all holidays, birthdays, family, friends...  Was there a choice?  No.  Did I have good doctors to support me?  Yes.  Was it my Rheumatologist?  No.  Was it my Primary Care Dr. who prescribed the 90 mg then no longer wanted to see me? No. It was the love of my life,  my Oncologist!  Yes!  He was by my side and saw me through every ugly event.  And there were soooo many!  I was also fortunate to have skipped over the mental side effects.  I didn't chase my husband with a skillet, threatening to kill him as my girlfriend did.  I did keep a good sense of humor.  My Neurologist (found about a year too late) has helped me through a lot of the pain in each and every muscle in my body and my head.  Topomax was a huge success in that area.  It helped to alleviate some of my 700+ day headache and also was effective in helping me loose some of the weight I have gained from Prednisone.  So, I guess there is hope.  I'm alive, I don't suffer from debilitating headaches, and I'm not blind.  I'm unsure of the status of my muscles, tendons and ligaments, bones, teeth, etc.  We'll see in the next year or so when, hopefully, this nightmare is over.  Good luck to all of you going down this bleak path...     Read More Read Less  "

I've been prescribed it when my asthma gets really severe. I've never taken it for more than 2 weeks at a time. I've always been very happy with the results. One of the side effects that I like is that my 60-year-old body has fewer aches and pains while I'm taking it. I'm on my second day of a 5-day treatment and already my breathing is improving. Because of scarring on my lungs via acid reflux I had a doctor want to put me on this med for a year and a half. After learning of all of the bad side effects I told him no way. 5-14 days is plenty for me and so far hasn't been detimental to my overall health.Read More Read Less  
1881,Deltasone Oral,9/9/2009,25-34,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Crohn,1.3,1,2,1,"I was very reluctant to take any corticosteroid, as I was worried about side effects. It took more than 10 years of disease activity before I gave in and finally took it. My doctor has prescribed it before, but prior to this year, I had never even filled the prescriptions.    I wish I wouldn't have given in. I thought maybe I was blowing the risks out of proportion, as my GI doctor has told me numerous time that I was overreacting, and that the drug was the safest of any.    Prior to being treated with prednisone, I had suffered through my symptoms, or taken medication that only controlled my symptoms.  I was much happier with both of those options, as miserable as the disease can be. I wasn't depressed before, now I am. I've been off of the steroids a month now, and I still have menstrual bleeding that started 3 months ago when the prednisone was started. It has been nonstop. My doctor said it would stop, and that it was nothing to worry about. Maybe she doesn't feel like having a relationship with her husband, I desperately want one with mine.      My skin is now very oily and I have terrible acne. I was told this would go away, but it's getting worse. My vision is blurry still, my eyes are dry and red, and they feel like they are filled with sand. I was told this was caused by my disease, not the drug. My eye doctor disagrees.      I was unable to sleep much despite being physically drained the entire time while on the medication. It was awful. Anti-anxiety medications didn't help. I also started having trouble with weakness after starting the medication. It was terrible. I could barely walk to my bedroom.    My advice, if your gut feeling is to run from this drug, run, and run fast. I had far less trouble with being on, and coming off of pain medication that I took to control the symptoms of my disease. They said those weren't safe, but I had no ill effects during or after treatment. They should be more cautious in prescribing this this as they are with pain medication.Read More Read Less  "

It made my face swell up, it made my legs and ankles swell to 3 times their normal size.  It made me so hungary all the time and the extra food made my blood sugar worse.   The drug did not help my medical problem asthma at all and only caused  me more problems, which may be a very serious kidney problem.  I was in the hospital this two month period, and I thought they were doing what was best for my health, but that was not the case using this horrible drug Prednisone, I do not believe I should have ever been given this terrible drug.

1894,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

I have actually  suffered with flare-up symptoms for well over 10 years, but no one could figure it out unfortunately. The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication. I always make sure to take it with food so I will not get dizzy or nauseous, since I have always had a bad case of vertigo with stronger medication‘s. So far things seem to be going in a better direction and I will update if anything changes. :-)Read More Read Less  "

1903,Mobic Oral,12/14/2019,55-64,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Joint Damage causing Pain and Loss of Function,5.0,5,5,5," 25 years ago, I took Mobic for back pain pursuant (I later found out) to a c-difficile infection that nearly killed me. Mobic, nor any of the other meds I was given-- helped the back pain at all at that time; and for many years I wrote this medication off as a placebo. However, recently I developed a spontaneous knee injury from long-distance walking. The knee capsule became so inflamed I could not walk or put any weight on my leg. My physician Rx'd Mobic. Lo and behold, it worked this time! It reduced the pain by about 95% and I could walk again. I've taken it for 2 wks and will stop in a few days; I received a cortisone injection in the knee.    Because of some of the long-term side effects, Mobic is probably best used for shorter-term treatments. Clearly, based on my experience, Mobic is not a panacea for all types of pain and many patients will be disappointed that it is not a cure-all. But for joint capsule pain it worked wonders for me. Mobic is a potent medication and MUST be taken with food on a full stomach.   I've come to the conclusion that Mobic, when used correctly for specific types of joint pain, can be very helpful. When used  'shotgun-style' for all types of pain, it is not effective. That is not the fault of the medication. Nor is the mis-use by the patient the fault of the medication, which seems to be part of the problem after reading some of the reviews on this site. Read More Read Less  "

I have actually  suffered with flare-up symptoms for well over 10 years, but no one could figure it out unfortunately. The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication. I always make sure to take it with food so I will not get dizzy or nauseous, since I have always had a bad case of vertigo with stronger medication‘s.

Mobic, nor any of the other meds I was given-- helped the back pain at all at that time; and for many years I wrote this medication off as a placebo. However, recently I developed a spontaneous knee injury from long-distance walking. The knee capsule became so inflamed I could not walk or put any weight on my leg. My physician Rx'd Mobic. Lo and behold, it worked this time! It reduced the pain by about 95% and I could walk again. I've taken it for 2 wks and will stop in a few days; I received a cortisone injection in the knee.    Because of some of the long-term side effects, Mobic is probably best used for shorter-term treatments. Clearly, based on my experience, Mobic is not a panacea for all types of pain and many patients will be disappointed that it is not a cure-all. But for joint capsule pain it worked wonders for me. Mobic is a potent medication and MUST be taken with food on a full stomach.   I've come to the conclusion that Mobic, when used correctly for specific types of joint pain, can be very helpful. When used  'shotgun-style' for all types of pain, it is not effective. That is not the fault of the medication. Nor is the mis-use by the patient the fault of the medication, which seems to be part of the problem after reading some of the reviews on this site. Read More Read Less  "

1934,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs.

1974,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2014,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2054,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2093,Mobic Oral,5/24/2023,,,,,Other,5.0,5,5,5,This has got to be the best pain med ever. The only drop is that it raises my pressure so l break the tablet in pieces and it still works. 
2094,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before.

2134,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication.

So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted -

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things.

I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had.

2234,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2274,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

However, recently I developed a spontaneous knee injury from long-distance walking. The knee capsule became so inflamed I could not walk or put any weight on my leg. My physician Rx'd Mobic. Lo and behold, it worked this time! It reduced the pain by about 95% and I could walk again. I've taken it for 2 wks and will stop in a few days; I received a cortisone injection in the knee.    Because of some of the long-term side effects, Mobic is probably best used for shorter-term treatments. Clearly, based on my experience, Mobic is not a panacea for all types of pain and many patients will be disappointed that it is not a cure-all. But for joint capsule pain it worked wonders for me. Mobic is a potent medication and MUST be taken with food on a full stomach.   I've come to the conclusion that Mobic, when used correctly for specific types of joint pain, can be very helpful.

2314,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2354,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2393,Mobic Oral,5/24/2023,,,,,Other,5.0,5,5,5,This has got to be the best pain med ever. The only drop is that it raises my pressure so l break the tablet in pieces and it still works. 
2394,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication.

Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication.

I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled.

However, recently I developed a spontaneous knee injury from long-distance walking. The knee capsule became so inflamed I could not walk or put any weight on my leg. My physician Rx'd Mobic.

2534,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

2574,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "

Lo and behold, it worked this time! It reduced the pain by about 95% and I could walk again. I've taken it for 2 wks and will stop in a few days; I received a cortisone injection in the knee.    Because of some of the long-term side effects, Mobic is probably best used for shorter-term treatments. Clearly, based on my experience, Mobic is not a panacea for all types of pain and many patients will be disappointed that it is not a cure-all. But for joint capsule pain it worked wonders for me. Mobic is a potent medication and MUST be taken with food on a full stomach.   I've come to the conclusion that Mobic, when used correctly for specific types of joint pain, can be very helpful. When used  'shotgun-style' for all types of pain, it is not effective. That is not the fault of the medication. Nor is the mis-use by the patient the fault of the medication, which seems to be part of the problem after reading some of the reviews on this site. Read More Read Less  "

2613,Mobic Oral,5/24/2023,,,,,Other,5.0,5,5,5,This has got to be the best pain med ever. The only drop is that it raises my pressure so l break the tablet in pieces and it still works. 
2614,Mobic Oral,1/27/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,3.0,3,4,2,"Had a 'physisians assistant' at urgi care tell me that my normal go to for migraines, Fioricet, is scheduled (the form I take is not) and that it's an opiate (which it isn't). Sure, it's not a first line treatment but it's the only thing that works for me, and I take the unscheduled formula that's 50mg Butalbital/40mg Caffeine/325 APAP. The PA was so hopeless he couldn't differentiate between FioirNAL with codeine and FioriCET that has no opiate. When he said 75% of his patients responded to IV Toradol I knew it was going to be bad. This was a rare case where I knew more than the PA did. The Toradol was useless as always and burned more than usual. 

I was pretty shocked when I saw what he had scripted - 
#10 Meloxicam (Mobic) 15mg once a day for migraine pain
#20 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) 25mg BID for nausea

What a waste! I told him that only Fioricet works for me, he saw my #120 monthly Valium RX and probably just assumed things. I can't see why else he'd give me Mobic when I have IBS and familial heart issues. I also requested Phenergan as an anti emetic but again he ignored that and decided to give me one of the worst RX drugs ever - hydroxyzine (Vistaril) should be OTC, its weaker than Benadryl and doesn't have any calming properties unless you're a psychotic. 

*What really gets me is the risk of abuse of Fioricet vs the risk of severe cardiotoxicity from the Mobic and that's not counting the GI experiences I had. Mobic is FAR more caustic than Butalbital, Caffeine or Tylenol. The risk of diversion is so low that it isn't scheduled. But Mobic, which can kill you early in treatment by way of stroke, heart attack and GI bleeding, gets thrown around like candy by day one doctor's who haven't slept enough or are overworked* 

The PA scripted ten 15mg Mobic tablets - he tried to start me on the max dose - I've used 7.5mg the last two days but am going to try 15mg and see if it makes a difference. So far this has felt like a ""glorified"" Naproxen. I notice a small amount of pain relief but it seems to also cause pain in the shoulders and upper body/back which happened on day 2 but was transient. 
This is day 3, am moving to 15mg Mobic single dose AM. I will only use this for 5 days not 10. 
As far as the hydroxyzine (Atarax/Vistaril) it's a weak antihistamine best used to get some sleep. It's NOT useful for anxiety or panic attacks; be wary of any doctor claiming these will help that. They do not and can make panic attacks worse.

*Doctors': We get it you don't want to RX Opiate drugs. However you're failing to see how dangerous something like Celebrex or Mobic is vs the opiate drug which is probably less harmful overall. NSAIDs damage GI, the heart, and increases risk of stroke. Percocet 10mg/325mg or Norco 10mg/325mg are more effective and less damaging than these awful NSAIDs. Thank GOD for the few DRs left that actually treat pain with PAINKILLERS NOT DEADLY NSAIDs*

Apparently I have to wait up to two weeks to see a difference in pain yet I only have ten 15mg tablets and started myself on 7.5mg so there's a chance I'm taking all the risk for NO reward. Read More Read Less  "
2615,Mobic Oral,7/16/2022,35-44,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,Rheumatic Disease causing Pain,4.0,4,4,4,"I was recently confirmed with the diagnoses of Lupus. I have actually  suffered with flare-up symptoms for well over 10 years, but no one could figure it out unfortunately. The joint pains were unbearable sometimes, and my sciatic nerve was a daily nightmare. I had spinal injections previously, as well as an injection in my foot for planter fasciitis pains, and it would all just be temporary relief for a year or so. My rheumatologist just prescribed me to Meloxicam/Mobic 15mg once a day recently and my sciatic pains have finally stopped for the most part it seems. I haven’t been taking it long enough to know if it will work long-term, but I haven’t had a sciatic nerve episode since I started taking it. I still get joint pains here and there, but not like they were. The only side effects I’ve noticed so far is my headaches have sometimes been more frequent, and sometimes I’ll get a sharp pain in the left side of my chest, but it’s nowhere near the downside of the pains I had before. I can at least lessen those side effects with and OTC medication. I always make sure to take it with food so I will not get dizzy or nauseous, since I have always had a bad case of vertigo with stronger medication‘s. So far things seem to be going in a better direction and I will update if anything changes. :-)Read More Read Less  "

Side effects I experienced were dry mouth, mouth sores, itchy rash, dry eyes and some lung problems.  The doctor prescribed Folic Acid 5mg per day to clear up the mouth sores.  It worked well.  I put up with the other side effects because they were the lesser of two evils, the other being RA flares.  Because I was on it so long, the doctor took me off it, without a replacement, and I was okay for a while, but just recently (2010), I had the worst flare of my life!  Maybe it's time to return to MTX.  I use acetametiphen with codeine if I feel a lot of pain because it doesn't bother my stomach as much as NSAIDs.  However, I always have to take them with a stool softener because they can be very constipating.  I also have Fibromyalgia & CFS, and have tried Lyrica and Neurontin for those symptoms.  The side effects were horrendous from both ... I was a zombie and couldn't function. My family begged me to get off them because they were affecting our relationships.  I also experienced short term emory loss while on these drugs, a function I've not been able to recoup.  Read More Read Less  "

As a result of the RA and the medication I have also developed Sjogren syndrome, which I take Evoxac for. The Methotrexate has contributed to my hair lose, dosage varies from .4cc to .6cc. When I go up to .5/.6 cc my skin starts to breakout in white blotches and itchy pimple like bumps, that when I scratch the skin comes off.  Although my Doctor tells me that I am in remission because I have not had any major flare ups, I tend to differ.  I say this because I am suppose to last six weeks pain free (since this is how often I take REMICADE) but by the second week I start hurting and have to start taking over the counter NSAIDS, by the third week I have to start taking Prednisone and needless to say but by this time, I also look forward and can’t hardly wait for my treatment and two weeks of complete pain free. In addition, I watch what I eat, practice yoga 2/3 times a week (even when I am hurting, it seems to help) and seat in the hot tub.

Took first 6 tablets at equal hourly intervals.  Slept 7 hours straight for first time for 4 months.  My problem was severe shoulder pain which WORSENED upon sleeping.  Changing position or sleeping upright did not help.  After taking 1st methylprednisone dose, other swollen or painful tissues and joints also became normal - swollen left hand went to normal size; middle finger knuckle on right hand went from 4 pain to zero pain (scale 0 to 10 where 10 = crying).  Eustachian tubes shrunk which improved my hearing.  Sinuses shrunk, which allowed them to drain (had been blocked for weeks).  Benefits persisted for next 5 days - I hope symptoms won't return.  Taking 500 mg Levofloxacin tablet 1/day for two weeks to treat sinus and Eustachian tube infection helped some, but improvement with methylprednisone was much greater.  With so many benefits and little risk, I suggest having a serious discussion with your healthcare provider if you think methylprednisone could possibly help you.Read More Read Less  "

2794,Methylprednisone Oral,12/31/2014,25-34,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Other,5.0,5,5,5,"I was given Methylprednisone along with Demerol and Phenergan so I'm not completely sure if it was a combination of medications or the Methylprednisone that made it work so good.  I had a stuck kidney stone, pneumonia and a Medtronic Reveal XT heart monitor installed all at the same time and had 2 surgeries within a few weeks.  Once I took the Methylprednisone I felt like I could breathe again and actually felt better than I do today.  I was able to do stuff while the prescriptions lasted but once they were out it was back to waking up with headaches puking in the middle of the night, getting dizzy spells, passing out, getting out of breath easy, hip pain, back pain and just overall hating my life because I feel like crap all the time.    Only if it were easy to get this medication once again but the doctors look at me like I'm some sort of crackhead.  I just want to be able to mow the lawn or work on my truck without having my eyes go blurry, getting dizzy and out of breath.    I hardly ever sleep anyways so I really didn't notice any problems with the medication.Read More Read Less  "
2795,Methylprednisone Oral,5/26/2014,65-74,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Inflammation of the Sac Surrounding the Joint,5.0,5,5,5,"Received 4 mg/tablet dosepak around 6 PM (21 tablets total).  Took first 6 tablets at equal hourly intervals.  Slept 7 hours straight for first time for 4 months.  My problem was severe shoulder pain which WORSENED upon sleeping.  Changing position or sleeping upright did not help.  After taking 1st methylprednisone dose, other swollen or painful tissues and joints also became normal - swollen left hand went to normal size; middle finger knuckle on right hand went from 4 pain to zero pain (scale 0 to 10 where 10 = crying).  Eustachian tubes shrunk which improved my hearing.  Sinuses shrunk, which allowed them to drain (had been blocked for weeks).  Benefits persisted for next 5 days - I hope symptoms won't return.  Taking 500 mg Levofloxacin tablet 1/day for two weeks to treat sinus and Eustachian tube infection helped some, but improvement with methylprednisone was much greater.  With so many benefits and little risk, I suggest having a serious discussion with your healthcare provider if you think methylprednisone could possibly help you.Read More Read Less  "

I called an allergist, got in same day.  He gave me Methypred Dose-Pak for 10 day dosing.  Instructions were to start off with 1.  I took it that evening and by the morning, my condition was almost gone.  Today is my last does of 16 mg and then I have to reduce the pills to wean myself off of them.  The allergist said my problem was Mountain Cedar(I was the 3rd person that day with the problem).  Since my skin was open from the Perm Cosmetic procedure, the Mountain Cedar played havoc with my eyes.  For me, this drug was a lifesaver.  It definitely worked for me.   Read More Read Less  "

After trying with no or scars success, several medications (from antihistamine, to antibiotics, decongestants, inhalators, ect)I had been prescribed by a doctor an injection of 2 x 40 mg of Kenalog. The result was incredible, after few days and for a month all symptoms were gone! After that I had been repeating the treatment monthly for a period of 5 years. The firsts visible side effects were skin edemas or profound superficial bleeding in case of a bruise or a scratch, but, much more serious, only much later realized or rather suspected, ... gradual loss of muscular mass (almost 10 Kg out of my 70 !), therefore, consequent loss of fitness, loss of sight, appearing of small warts,on different parts of the body!  During all this time I took several medical tests, which they were showing pretty much normal results, but, among all the doctors that visited me, a part generally advising me that ""the cortisone injections were not advisable"",  no one had been able to clearly warn me and explain to me the specific critical ""side effects"" above mentioned. I have now stopped that treatment since last February and replaced, with some efforts, with homeopathic treatments  but, although I managed to control the symptoms, the unpleasant ""side effects"" in 8 months,... are not yet disappeared or, in a very minimal proportion.

The injections were given every six weeks and were quite painful. The area on the head remained sore to touch before and after the injections but the process continued by two different dermatologist. After 18 months of treatment with the first dermatilogist I switched to another. The process continued at the recommendations of the new dermatologist indicating the lesions were persistent and difficult to treat. A little less than two years went by with more injections and the results were the same. After more than three years of treatment without any positive appreciable change I dropped the dermatologist. The affected scalp area had started scarring where the injectons were adminisstered but the injections continued. The lesions (keloids) on my back grew and hardened. One grew from the size of a navy bean to the size of a silver dollar two others that received injections grew to the size of a quarter. Another that appears as a blemish with a core apparently has a rogue nerve that is very painful. It feels as though someone is stabbing me with a hot poker much more often than I like. All of the lesions(keloids)on the scalp and on the back itch terribly. I suffer from RA (autoimmune disease) and have been prescribed various meds that I know believe may have caused skin problems that were possibly exacerbated by TAC 40. The lesions are still there and it seems there is nothing that can be done about them. Where are the trained experts?

All covid tests and antibody tests turned out negative and nobody in my immediate family developed covid.  My primary doctor ordered every sort of testing, plus temporarily took away all the meds she prescribed to try and find the cause of my symptoms.  This testing went on for 2 years.

I looked back on when the change over back to Sulfasalazine was made and it was Feb 11, 2020.  I  asked my primary why it worked earlier without side effects and not now.  She said the contents were probably the same but the coating might be different.  I did notice the coating was different the second time around I took it.

The one thing that really bothers me is sensitivity to the sun.  I burn easily now even with 30 sunscreen and I enjoy being outside in the summer.  Before being on this I rarely burned.  I am worried about skin cancer.  I am thinking of going off and seeing how I do.  Has anyone had any luck with natural supplements or avoiding certain foods?  I have heard turmeric helps but Iâ??m not sure how much to take.  Medrol does help with my flare ups but as far as this medicine Iâ??m not sure how much itâ??s helping.

As other drugs came along, Sulfasalazine was one of the drugs that was prescribed for me in the 70's or 80's.  It worked and no problems whatsoever.  At the beginning of 2020 the cost went up for Mesalamine which I was on at the time so I asked if I could be switched back to the cheaper Sulfasalazine because it worked before.  When covid19 hit the US I did not have symptoms of covid but I developed long haul symptoms of chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, hair loss and brain fog.  All covid tests and antibody tests turned out negative and nobody in my immediate family developed covid.  My primary doctor ordered every sort of testing, plus temporarily took away all the meds she prescribed to try and find the cause of my symptoms.  This testing went on for 2 years.  Finally, at the end of 2021 I told my GI doc and he temporarily took away the Sulfasalazine, and within a couple days my side effects completely disappeared.  I looked back on when the change over back to Sulfasalazine was made and it was Feb 11, 2020.  I  asked my primary why it worked earlier without side effects and not now.  She said the contents were probably the same but the coating might be different.  I did notice the coating was different the second time around I took it.

As other drugs came along, Sulfasalazine was one of the drugs that was prescribed for me in the 70's or 80's.  It worked and no problems whatsoever.  At the beginning of 2020 the cost went up for Mesalamine which I was on at the time so I asked if I could be switched back to the cheaper Sulfasalazine because it worked before.  When covid19 hit the US I did not have symptoms of covid but I developed long haul symptoms of chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, hair loss and brain fog.  All covid tests and antibody tests turned out negative and nobody in my immediate family developed covid.  My primary doctor ordered every sort of testing, plus temporarily took away all the meds she prescribed to try and find the cause of my symptoms.  This testing went on for 2 years.  Finally, at the end of 2021 I told my GI doc and he temporarily took away the Sulfasalazine, and within a couple days my side effects completely disappeared.  I looked back on when the change over back to Sulfasalazine was made and it was Feb 11, 2020.  I  asked my primary why it worked earlier without side effects and not now.  She said the contents were probably the same but the coating might be different.  I did notice the coating was different the second time around I took it.   The new version left a brown chalky residue on my hands and anything I touched before washing my hands.  The earlier version did not leave a residue.

I'm on weaning dose of prednisolone again now (one 5mg a day) and CRP has crept back up to 11 (lowest was 6).

I went on 1,500mg/day. The pain slowly started to come back. At the 2,000/day mark, the pain was back fully. I tried Epsom salt baths, icy hot, heating pads, massage. I got so desperate for relief, I started taking ibuprofen! After speaking with others online, they told me to get tested for rhabdomyolysis. I went to the ER. Tests came back negative but the docs said if it hasn’t progressed enough, the CK tests wouldn’t pick it up. Needless to say, I’m done with sulfasalazine. The side effects were awful.

I went out of remission, switched doctors and started on Kevzara and Sulfasalazine. I had problems w/ leaky gut and IBD for a very long time.

After I went back in to remission I slowly reduced my dose to 1 - 2x per day. I know it's the sulfasalazine that helped me because a couple times my dr wanted me to try to stop taking it - just to reduce the amount of meds I was taking and my IBD flared every time I went down to less that 2 / day.

As other drugs came along, Sulfasalazine was one of the drugs that was prescribed for me in the 70's or 80's.  It worked and no problems whatsoever.  At the beginning of 2020 the cost went up for Mesalamine which I was on at the time so I asked if I could be switched back to the cheaper Sulfasalazine because it worked before.  When covid19 hit the US I did not have symptoms of covid but I developed long haul symptoms of chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, hair loss and brain fog.  All covid tests and antibody tests turned out negative and nobody in my immediate family developed covid.  My primary doctor ordered every sort of testing, plus temporarily took away all the meds she prescribed to try and find the cause of my symptoms.  This testing went on for 2 years.  Finally, at the end of 2021 I told my GI doc and he temporarily took away the Sulfasalazine, and within a couple days my side effects completely disappeared.  I looked back on when the change over back to Sulfasalazine was made and it was Feb 11, 2020.  I  asked my primary why it worked earlier without side effects and not now.  She said the contents were probably the same but the coating might be different.  I did notice the coating was different the second time around I took it.   The new version left a brown chalky residue on my hands and anything I touched before washing my hands.  The earlier version did not leave a residue.

I'm on weaning dose of prednisolone again now (one 5mg a day) and CRP has crept back up to 11 (lowest was 6).

As other drugs came along, Sulfasalazine was one of the drugs that was prescribed for me in the 70's or 80's.  It worked and no problems whatsoever.  At the beginning of 2020 the cost went up for Mesalamine which I was on at the time so I asked if I could be switched back to the cheaper Sulfasalazine because it worked before.  When covid19 hit the US I did not have symptoms of covid but I developed long haul symptoms of chronic fatigue, loss of appetite, hair loss and brain fog.  All covid tests and antibody tests turned out negative and nobody in my immediate family developed covid.  My primary doctor ordered every sort of testing, plus temporarily took away all the meds she prescribed to try and find the cause of my symptoms.  This testing went on for 2 years.  Finally, at the end of 2021 I told my GI doc and he temporarily took away the Sulfasalazine, and within a couple days my side effects completely disappeared.  I looked back on when the change over back to Sulfasalazine was made and it was Feb 11, 2020.  I  asked my primary why it worked earlier without side effects and not now.  She said the contents were probably the same but the coating might be different.  I did notice the coating was different the second time around I took it.   The new version left a brown chalky residue on my hands and anything I touched before washing my hands.  The earlier version did not leave a residue.  Since being taken off Sulfasalazine those side effects have not returned.Read More Read Less  "
3097,Sulfasalazine Oral,2/23/2022,55-64,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Rheumatoid Arthritis,2.7,2,3,3,"Been on Sulfasalazine 2 x 500mg x 2 /day for about 5 months.  I've had mild side effects, nausea mostly has now passed as long as I eat before taking them.  Constantly tired but I assume this is the RA.  After starting Sulfasalazine (and coming off prednisolone) my symptoms got worse and CRP was 52.  I had to go back on to prednisolone due to pain and swelling.  I'm on weaning dose of prednisolone again now (one 5mg a day) and CRP has crept back up to 11 (lowest was 6).  All this suggests the Sulfasalazine isn't working, and swelling / pain in my hands is slowly getting worse. At next review I suspect I'll be switched to methotrexate.      Read More Read Less  "

This is the first DMARD I’ve tried, I’ve only been on an NSAID (meloxicam) before now. I’m starting to do things I have not been able to do in years.

I lost so much sleep because my whole body hurt. I was on 3,000mg/day. I decided to come off it. We found out I was vitamin D deficient. So I got on supplements also. Doc wanted me to try ssz again. I went on 1,500mg/day. The pain slowly started to come back. At the 2,000/day mark, the pain was back fully. I tried Epsom salt baths, icy hot, heating pads, massage. I got so desperate for relief, I started taking ibuprofen! After speaking with others online, they told me to get tested for rhabdomyolysis. I went to the ER. Tests came back negative but the docs said if it hasn’t progressed enough, the CK tests wouldn’t pick it up. Needless to say, I’m done with sulfasalazine. The side effects were awful.

After I went back in to remission I slowly reduced my dose to 1 - 2x per day. I know it's the sulfasalazine that helped me because a couple times my dr wanted me to try to stop taking it - just to reduce the amount of meds I was taking and my IBD flared every time I went down to less that 2 / day.

I read all the reviews here before taking it  for Gout because I was scared. Now I want to share my experience with it. I had untreated gout for like 3 weeks. Left foot was swollen bad. Doctor gave me 20-30mg per day for 7 days. I finally started it after a day of his prescription and I was surprised that in 2-3 days the swelling magically vanished. The only side effect it had was a little tummy ache but nothing an ol bowl of yogurt cant fix. The doctor had also given me a PPI omeprazole before having this med. (before breakfast omeprazole, breakfast, after breakfast prednisolone). 
When i stopped it the 7th day the swelling came back the very next day but somehow it was a bit better and my new NSAID course that started immediately (diclofenac) helped the swelling come down in 3-4 days. So my experience with this med was really good, non scary and insignificant side effects. It helped break down the severity of the goit inflammation. Read More Read Less  "

I had developed severe  psoriasis. After 7 days on the medicine at 5mg 2 times a day. I became very irritable. Developed headaches, was dizzy, short of breath, nausea. I would cry over nothing. I have never been a suicidal person but thought several times while taking this medication how easy it would be to put a gun to my head & pull the trigger. I wasn’t upset about anything but would think that I could do it without even having a reason & how easy it would be to just do it & not even think about it. I slept for 2 days, didn’t eat for 2 days, even though I was told it would increase my appetite. I stopped the medicine & the first day off of it I felt the same still had the side effects. Was wondering how long it would take to get out of my system. I know all meds effect everyone different but I will never take this one again & think more warnings should be put out about it. I’m sure it helps some but my side effects were much worse than the benefits. I have seen nothing in the way of improvements for my conditions that it was prescribed for. I did call my Dr. his nurse talked to him gave him the message of my side effects. His nurse called back said the Dr. said he did not think it was the prednisone causing this & suggested I lower the dose to one daily but that if I wanted to stop taking it I could.

When i stopped it the 7th day the swelling came back the very next day but somehow it was a bit better and my new NSAID course that started immediately (diclofenac) helped the swelling come down in 3-4 days.

I read all the reviews here before taking it  for Gout because I was scared. Now I want to share my experience with it. I had untreated gout for like 3 weeks. Left foot was swollen bad. Doctor gave me 20-30mg per day for 7 days. I finally started it after a day of his prescription and I was surprised that in 2-3 days the swelling magically vanished. The only side effect it had was a little tummy ache but nothing an ol bowl of yogurt cant fix. The doctor had also given me a PPI omeprazole before having this med. (before breakfast omeprazole, breakfast, after breakfast prednisolone). 
When i stopped it the 7th day the swelling came back the very next day but somehow it was a bit better and my new NSAID course that started immediately (diclofenac) helped the swelling come down in 3-4 days. So my experience with this med was really good, non scary and insignificant side effects. It helped break down the severity of the goit inflammation. Read More Read Less  "

I have never been a suicidal person but thought several times while taking this medication how easy it would be to put a gun to my head & pull the trigger. I wasn’t upset about anything but would think that I could do it without even having a reason & how easy it would be to just do it & not even think about it. I slept for 2 days, didn’t eat for 2 days, even though I was told it would increase my appetite. I stopped the medicine & the first day off of it I felt the same still had the side effects. Was wondering how long it would take to get out of my system. I know all meds effect everyone different but I will never take this one again & think more warnings should be put out about it. I’m sure it helps some but my side effects were much worse than the benefits. I have seen nothing in the way of improvements for my conditions that it was prescribed for. I did call my Dr. his nurse talked to him gave him the message of my side effects.

I read all the reviews here before taking it  for Gout because I was scared. Now I want to share my experience with it. I had untreated gout for like 3 weeks. Left foot was swollen bad. Doctor gave me 20-30mg per day for 7 days. I finally started it after a day of his prescription and I was surprised that in 2-3 days the swelling magically vanished. The only side effect it had was a little tummy ache but nothing an ol bowl of yogurt cant fix. The doctor had also given me a PPI omeprazole before having this med. (before breakfast omeprazole, breakfast, after breakfast prednisolone). 
When i stopped it the 7th day the swelling came back the very next day but somehow it was a bit better and my new NSAID course that started immediately (diclofenac) helped the swelling come down in 3-4 days. So my experience with this med was really good, non scary and insignificant side effects. It helped break down the severity of the goit inflammation. Read More Read Less  "

Was wondering how long it would take to get out of my system. I know all meds effect everyone different but I will never take this one again & think more warnings should be put out about it. I’m sure it helps some but my side effects were much worse than the benefits. I have seen nothing in the way of improvements for my conditions that it was prescribed for.

The Orudis SR 200mg capsules (1 per day) did nothing to ease my pain. I completely lost my appetite and experienced significant stomach/bowel discomfort. After the eighth day I suffered a severe heart reaction (enormous chest-thumping palpitations, tingles in left arm, tight chest) which left me feeling weak for several days. ECG indicated that I had NOT suffered a heart attack.

But I must warn those taking ANY NSAIDS(Ibuprophen,Naproxen,etc.) that overuse (long term use or taking more than prescribed or suggested) can lead to dangerous and sometimes deadly side effects. So for you people taking ""handfuls"" of this or any other NSAID drug, talk to your doctor. These types of medications can cause stomach bleeding, kidney and sometimes even liver problems, and they indeed can put unintended stress on the heart that can lead to heart attacks and/or stroke. So please discuss these medications with your doctor if you are taking them long term or in high doses!Read More Read Less  "

5232,Orudis Oral,11/8/2009,65-74,Female,10 years or more,Patient,Pain,4.7,4,5,5,"I've been taking Orudis since 1992 when I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  It has worked adequately for me most of the time.  It must be taken regularly (I take it twice a day, 75 mg each capsule) so there is a constant level of the drug in your bloodstream.  I always take it with food, just as I would aspirin or ibuprofen.  It has made the pain tolerable without causing any unwelcome side effects, such as drowsiness or that ""loopy"" feeling. One side effect is uneven tanning if you are exposed to a lot of sunlight.  Also, I gained weight when I first started taking it until I realized the medicine was contributing to my increased eating.  Over the past 17 years I've tried many other pain medicines both narcotic and non-narcotic and this one has been the best choice when taking into consideration all the benefits and all the possible bad effects. This medication is NOT habit-forming, which is very important to me.  I keep other pain relievers on hand (narcotic) for those really bad days, but only take those a few times a month so there is never a dependency built up. I would recommend this medication to anyone with chronic, moderate pain.Read More Read Less  "

I think this works better on my TMJ than any other NSAID out there.  I gave it three stars for ease of use because 1) I am directed to take 6 pills three times a day, and eighteen pills is a lot to swollow (I will have to just get a presription written), and 2)it is really hard to find OTC."

Within two days was having chills followed by fever 100/101. Drenching night sweats.  Body aches, muscle weakness, staggering and off balance, light headed, wheezy.  Mood swings and very agitated (because I felt so bad?) Couldn't breathe, had changes in vision.  did this for most of June.  NEVER AGAIN! Two doctors said I was probably suffering a reaction to a preservative in the suspension.  Should have been warned, I wouldn't have done it.  Whatever I reacted to, in Sept I had a reaction to something that fruit was treated with and went into anaphylaxis shock and would have died had I not been in ER.  Afraid of everything now.  Allergy tests in my future to figure out what to avoid.Read More Read Less  "
