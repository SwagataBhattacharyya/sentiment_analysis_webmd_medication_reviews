83,Aller-Flo Nasal,2/8/2022,,Male,6 months to less than 1 year,Patient,Inflammation of the Nose due to an Allergy,5.0,5,5,5,"During fifty years I have suffer of an allergy that blocked my left nose-thrill, gave me a pain in my left sinus and affected my speech, since I hear  my voice inside my left ear so, speaking in a loud voice, was very painful.
I spent thousands of dollars in visits to several of the best doctors, laboratory and  hearing tests, even a very famous doctor recommended me to insensibilize my left ear to finish this problem, that of course I did not accept.
I had  my nose septum straighter because one doctor said that was my problem. It did not helped, others gave me almost all the nose sprays available, did not work, other changed my food intake, did not work, and so on and so forth.
Finally I realized there was no cure for me and decided I had to live with this problem for the rest of my life.
Six months ago, accompanying my wife to a shopping mall I discovered Flo-nose, by curiosity and because of the good price and that it is sold over the counter I decided to give it a tray.
My great surprise was that at the first two shots my blocked nose-thrill and ear pain,  as I talked, improved so I decided to take a daily use for a long period of time and has really helped me, I can breath perfectly now and the ear problem has improved, although not at all, but I am confident that if I continue with its use I finally will be cured. 
Thank you Aller-flo and the scientists that developed this wonderful medicine.

Then in 02/2017 I immediately stopped taking it because urine flow stopped the first night of a week cruise. I had to have an internal catheter inserted connected to an external leg bag by cruise medical staff. After I got home it took my urologist 9 months to get my prostate back to normal and catheter removed. (it was removed several times during this time period but had to be reinserted within few hours since still not normal). I have been fine ever since after that 9th month when removed. Note: I was on prostate med (Tamsulosin) for years before I took Claritin and never had problem.

I have BPH (enlarged prostate) for several years and knew I could not take an antihistamine with the warning on it: ""Do not take if you have an enlarged prostate"" (because within few days it can stop a man's urine flow!) I saw Claritin, a leading worldwide OTC drug and figured it must be special because it did not have this warning. I took it for over a year in 2016 and it worked great allowing me to do my job working 8-10 hours a day in medical  eqipment  business. Then in 02/2017 I immediately stopped taking it because urine flow stopped the first night of a week cruise. I had to have an internal catheter inserted connected to an external leg bag by cruise medical staff. After I got home it took my urologist 9 months to get my prostate back to normal and catheter removed. (it was removed several times during this time period but had to be reinserted within few hours since still not normal). I have been fine ever since after that 9th month when removed. Note: I was on prostate med (Tamsulosin) for years before I took Claritin and never had problem.

375,Loratadine Oral,12/5/2020,65-74,,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Stuffy Nose,3.7,5,5,1,"I had constant runny nose during day at work and it was very annoying. I have BPH (enlarged prostate) for several years and knew I could not take an antihistamine with the warning on it: ""Do not take if you have an enlarged prostate"" (because within few days it can stop a man's urine flow!) I saw Claritin, a leading worldwide OTC drug and figured it must be special because it did not have this warning. I took it for over a year in 2016 and it worked great allowing me to do my job working 8-10 hours a day in medical  eqipment  business. Then in 02/2017 I immediately stopped taking it because urine flow stopped the first night of a week cruise. I had to have an internal catheter inserted connected to an external leg bag by cruise medical staff. After I got home it took my urologist 9 months to get my prostate back to normal and catheter removed. (it was removed several times during this time period but had to be reinserted within few hours since still not normal). I have been fine ever since after that 9th month when removed. Note: I was on prostate med (Tamsulosin) for years before I took Claritin and never had problem.
