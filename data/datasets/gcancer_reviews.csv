I had an allergic reaction in which my feet burned like I walked on hot coals.

I was told that my name was added to ""a list"" but was not given any further information. In the months and now 2 years  that followed, I suffered from mild neuropathy in my feet and hands but what was worse was this gnawing pain in my back that has progressively gotten worse. I wasn't even able to take a shower because the water hurt my back as it came out of the shower head. I began to ask my oncologist what this pain was and he seemed baffled and didn't make any connection to the Taxotere incident whatsoever. Each time I mentioned it, he refuted that it was safe and not related. I had numerous MRIs and a PET scan, a full spinal x-ray series, CT scans and even a thorasic spinal epidural to try and relieve the pain and find the root of my pain. All came back that I was fine. With no further answers and help from my oncology team, I decided to seek help from other specialsist. I am now being seen by a Pain Management doctor who is treating my pain as nerve damage from the Taxotere. I am on heavy doses of pain meds and have drastically altered my quality of life. The pain is more manageable than it had been earlier, but it is ever present and masked by medication. I was NEVER informed that chronic nerve damage in my back could be a possible side effect.

Be forewarned-you could lose your hair permanently and add the insult of alopecia to the injury of breast cancer. So far my cancer remains in remission (they don't say cured, they say remission), but I still continue to fight neuropathy, fatique, low blood counts and chemo brain. And again, it has been 2 years! I am grateful to be alive but if I had been given a choice of something that would not cause all these problems and still kill off the cancer cells, I would have certainly chosen something else.

Be forewarned-you could lose your hair permanently and add the insult of alopecia to the injury of breast cancer. So far my cancer remains in remission (they don't say cured, they say remission), but I still continue to fight neuropathy, fatique, low blood counts and chemo brain. And again, it has been 2 years! I am grateful to be alive but if I had been given a choice of something that would not cause all these problems and still kill off the cancer cells, I would have certainly chosen something else.

He got diagnosed with stage 4 small cell lung cancer with metastasis in the liver and lymph nodes on Father’s Day 2018. He immediately began targeted chemo therapy and radiation. After his first round of chemo they did a new CT scan and PET scan, miraculously the doctor said the cancer is reduced to scarring and continued the radiation preventively. 3 months later he is back in the hospital and things are not looking good but he is still stable at this point. His oncologist suggested this medication. WHICH IS NOT YET FDA APPROVED (despite having previously told my father to avoid anything that is not FDA approved). I supported my father in whichever steps he took but I was reluctant about this medication. From the first dose it was a rapid decline. Like I said he was stable before and after he began this medication absolutely everything went horribly wrong. He couldn’t eat, sleep, he felt more short of breath than he did when he had 900 cc’s of fluid in his lungs. This is medical malpractice. I can’t help but feel that they used my dad as some sort of lab rat to test this on. I know that cancer is terrifying and I know that you may feel there are not many options, but please consider finding another option than this medication. My father was strong even in his final moments but I genuinely feel he would still be here with me if not for this medication. Read More Read Less  "

My pet scan in 6 months showed that may cancer had spread and more spots showed on my liver. At this time they added Yervoy with the opdivo. This combo was just approved right before i stated taking it. I had two dose of the combo drug and got very sick. I experienced most of the rare side effects. 1st it was the colitis which landed me in the hospital for about 1 week with severe dehydration. Next was swelling of my knees it was so severe it they needed to be drained weekly. Next side effect was Stephen Johnson's syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis which basically almost killed me. The toxic rash spread over 90% of my body and I was not responding to meds. Three weeks in the ICU burn unit and I was told I could no long have the immunotherapy. Almost 6-7 months of just heeling, I had another pet scan that showed the tumor had spread to another area. At this point i still needed to heal and they scheduled a new pet scan in three months. So the week before Christmas this year, we had that scan, for days later I was given the results. The immuniotherapy worked, I was CANCER FREE! These meds made me very very sick and almost killed me but in the end, I am a 45 year old father that will be able to see his children grow up!

After the 3rd dose, his abdomen started bloating in the liver area, he got weak, then had facial drooping.  We told the oncologist and he suggested steroids then another dose after a week delay.  One more dose, my dad was barely walking, slurred speech, barely eating, increased edema in abdomen and legs.  Then at 4am, my mom calls me.  My dad somehow made it to the kitchen and couldnt stand, couldnt walk, could barely talk!!!!  We called an ambulance and sat in ER, then admitted to hosp.

Chemo oncologist said reaction was heart related and refused to administer second round of chemo as this could cause a heart attack. Pt scan looked clear, but cancer returned to other lymph nodes the next year. Radiation and cysplatin were the treatments. Clear scan followed. There are no other drugs to use if cancer returns. Certainly wish there was more research for this type of cancer. Cannot find any new studies. Perhaps because this is rare, no one is working on another cure.

I had triple neg and surgery after chemo removed most of the tumors, the last 2 in middle of my chest were removed by Xeloda within a few months.  They were cut in half within 1 month!  I am currently taking 3 pills twice a day and have hardly any side effects.  I take good care of my feet so I don't get Hand and Foot Syndrome again, putting lotion on at least once a day, shoes off after walk, watch for redness and ice them if I overdo it (i.e. play tennis then do yard work when it is hot).  The other effects are minor constipation but I eat wheat cereal and maybe take an extra probiotic later in the day.  The thing that bugs me the most is the red spots that appear on face and arms, esp. since it is Summer and hot here.  Apricot scrub helps reduce them quickly.

Also, developed a rash on chest, upper arms and back and face which was relieved by Kenalog creme (0.1%) quickly.   HFS 90% better after 4 days of using the 10% Urea lotion 3x/day (Cetaphil is inexpensive).  I seem to have less of a quesy stomach if I eat better, cutting out the junk food.  My off weeks were nice with none of the effects from cycle 1 above.  In summary,  it seems that drinking 1-2 qts. of water,  elevating off my feet hours per day, applying lotion 3x/day to hands and feet and eating well has helped me to have less side effects in these first 2 cycles.

*Started 10% Urea lotion again 3x a day once HFS started.  I feel like it could have been prevented if I would have kept up with the 3x/day I did 1st few weeks and drinking close to 2 qts. of water plus not taking such hot showers.

I had triple neg and surgery after chemo removed most of the tumors, the last 2 in middle of my chest were removed by Xeloda within a few months.  They were cut in half within 1 month!  I am currently taking 3 pills twice a day and have hardly any side effects.  I take good care of my feet so I don't get Hand and Foot Syndrome again, putting lotion on at least once a day, shoes off after walk, watch for redness and ice them if I overdo it (i.e. play tennis then do yard work when it is hot).  The other effects are minor constipation but I eat wheat cereal and maybe take an extra probiotic later in the day.  The thing that bugs me the most is the red spots that appear on face and arms, esp. since it is Summer and hot here.  Apricot scrub helps reduce them quickly.

157,Xeloda Oral,1/26/2022,55-64,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer,5.0,5,5,5,"I have been on Xeloda for 6 weeks now and had 1st confirmation that my 2 diseased lymph nodes in middle of chest were ""Significantly Decreased in size"", Yay!m My side effects started 1st cycle, week 2 with cramps, loose stools, minor nausea and quesy stomach at times.  2nd cycle, week 2 worsened, with Hand and Foot Syndrome on feet only*, cramps more severe.  Also, developed a rash on chest, upper arms and back and face which was relieved by Kenalog creme (0.1%) quickly.   HFS 90% better after 4 days of using the 10% Urea lotion 3x/day (Cetaphil is inexpensive).  I seem to have less of a quesy stomach if I eat better, cutting out the junk food.  My off weeks were nice with none of the effects from cycle 1 above.  In summary,  it seems that drinking 1-2 qts. of water,  elevating off my feet hours per day, applying lotion 3x/day to hands and feet and eating well has helped me to have less side effects in these first 2 cycles.

*Started 10% Urea lotion again 3x a day once HFS started.  I feel like it could have been prevented if I would have kept up with the 3x/day I did 1st few weeks and drinking close to 2 qts. of water plus not taking such hot showers.   I had read if using that lotion for 1st 6 weeks of treatment, it can prevent HFS.

Her liver was so swollen that she could barely swallow her tiny pain pills every four hours. We had to be creative -using honey and Jell-O to keep pills from getting stuck in her throat.    I’m guessing that this drug is intended for younger or healthier people, and that in my mom’s case, it probably robbed her of some precious time with her family. She is so much weaker now than before.Read More Read Less  "

I had triple neg and surgery after chemo removed most of the tumors, the last 2 in middle of my chest were removed by Xeloda within a few months.  They were cut in half within 1 month!  I am currently taking 3 pills twice a day and have hardly any side effects.  I take good care of my feet so I don't get Hand and Foot Syndrome again, putting lotion on at least once a day, shoes off after walk, watch for redness and ice them if I overdo it (i.e. play tennis then do yard work when it is hot).  The other effects are minor constipation but I eat wheat cereal and maybe take an extra probiotic later in the day.  The thing that bugs me the most is the red spots that appear on face and arms, esp. since it is Summer and hot here.  Apricot scrub helps reduce them quickly.

197,Xeloda Oral,1/26/2022,55-64,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer,5.0,5,5,5,"I have been on Xeloda for 6 weeks now and had 1st confirmation that my 2 diseased lymph nodes in middle of chest were ""Significantly Decreased in size"", Yay!m My side effects started 1st cycle, week 2 with cramps, loose stools, minor nausea and quesy stomach at times.  2nd cycle, week 2 worsened, with Hand and Foot Syndrome on feet only*, cramps more severe.  Also, developed a rash on chest, upper arms and back and face which was relieved by Kenalog creme (0.1%) quickly.   HFS 90% better after 4 days of using the 10% Urea lotion 3x/day (Cetaphil is inexpensive).  I seem to have less of a quesy stomach if I eat better, cutting out the junk food.  My off weeks were nice with none of the effects from cycle 1 above.  In summary,  it seems that drinking 1-2 qts. of water,  elevating off my feet hours per day, applying lotion 3x/day to hands and feet and eating well has helped me to have less side effects in these first 2 cycles.

*Started 10% Urea lotion again 3x a day once HFS started.  I feel like it could have been prevented if I would have kept up with the 3x/day I did 1st few weeks and drinking close to 2 qts. of water plus not taking such hot showers.   I had read if using that lotion for 1st 6 weeks of treatment, it can prevent HFS.

The thing that bugs me the most is the red spots that appear on face and arms, esp. since it is Summer and hot here.  Apricot scrub helps reduce them quickly.  So, I AM ALIVE.... and just a bit spotty!  Hang in there all and hopefully you will have the same blessings I have had.Read More Read Less  "

Yes, I have the hand and foot syndrome,  diarrhea and fatigue.  However, my tumors are shrinking and my MRI yesterday showed no new mets in my brain. Yeah!"
236,Xeloda Oral,3/21/2022,25-34,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Other,2.0,2,3,1,"Xeloda gave me severe side effects. I couldn’t eat, drink or speak because of the mouth sores on my mouth and throat. I ended up in the hospital boarder line to death. I had severe diarrhea and started vomiting. I was in the hospital for 22 days due to my body not reacting well to xeloda."
237,Xeloda Oral,1/26/2022,55-64,Female,1 to 6 months,Patient,metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer,5.0,5,5,5,"I have been on Xeloda for 6 weeks now and had 1st confirmation that my 2 diseased lymph nodes in middle of chest were ""Significantly Decreased in size"", Yay!m My side effects started 1st cycle, week 2 with cramps, loose stools, minor nausea and quesy stomach at times.  2nd cycle, week 2 worsened, with Hand and Foot Syndrome on feet only*, cramps more severe.  Also, developed a rash on chest, upper arms and back and face which was relieved by Kenalog creme (0.1%) quickly.   HFS 90% better after 4 days of using the 10% Urea lotion 3x/day (Cetaphil is inexpensive).  I seem to have less of a quesy stomach if I eat better, cutting out the junk food.  My off weeks were nice with none of the effects from cycle 1 above.  In summary,  it seems that drinking 1-2 qts. of water,  elevating off my feet hours per day, applying lotion 3x/day to hands and feet and eating well has helped me to have less side effects in these first 2 cycles.

*Started 10% Urea lotion again 3x a day once HFS started.  I feel like it could have been prevented if I would have kept up with the 3x/day I did 1st few weeks and drinking close to 2 qts. of water plus not taking such hot showers.   I had read if using that lotion for 1st 6 weeks of treatment, it can prevent HFS.   

My heart goes out to all of you women dealing with this  It is a rough road, worse for some than others.  This page has helped me a lot, I have come back many times to re-read parts and have gained encouragement.  May God bless each of you and give you peace and strength to endure.

Her liver was so swollen that she could barely swallow her tiny pain pills every four hours. We had to be creative -using honey and Jell-O to keep pills from getting stuck in her throat.

The cancer had spread to the chest and lung and the chemo (11/08-3/09) was successful.    Eight months later the cancer returned to the neck, which was removed. Radiation of head neck followed (33 sessions). Also during this time a nodule was found in the brain. Simultaneous to the radiation I had CyberKnife of the brain done. A double dose of radiation.    The fatigue, and side effects, caused by the radiation was greater than chemo, but, one month since the last radiation, I am very hopeful about the future.Read More Read Less  "
