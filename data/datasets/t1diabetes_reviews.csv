Since too much or too little fast-acting Insulin can cause death, this is a very serious matter; this is over and above the huge financial loss incurred by unsuspecting patients at your retail price of over $1,000 per two pens.    Over several years, at least half of the dispensed medications have been defective and results in too little or too much insulin injected into me.     The gearing mechanism in those devices that converts the     Manufacturer Lilly's phone line connects hapless patients to a labyrinth of submenus of byzantine complexity that it is useless, possibly by design.Read More Read Less  "

I had blurred vision after every bolus with normal BS for hours, nauseated, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, hard to breathe, fatigued, huge raw rash all over my shoulders, lost hair in huge amounts, thought I had cancer. Was not as effective as Novalog so I went into DKA twice in 3 months. Got good insurance so got my Novalog back. Will never take Humalog again. Read More Read Less  "

I hated having to do the four times a day shots along with six times a day finger pricks. My doctor suggested I think about using an insulin pump. I went to the required classes for the pump and got it. It is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I use about 200 units of humalog every other day. The average hourly dose is around 2.65 units. All I have to keep up with now is watching what I eat, and about twice a day finger sticks. Read More Read Less  "

One week later I'm having a hard time even reading this enlarged print. Safe dariving speed on open highway is 40mph or less. Eyes can't respond to light changes, everything in sunlight all washed out, sky white. These drugs lowered my blood sugar but this is one hell of a high price to pay for it.  I keep looking on the net for reference to these eye problems and can't find anything except ""blurry vision"" once in awhile.

17,Humalog U-100 Insulin Subcutaneous,10/4/2010,35-44,Female,1 to less than 2 years,,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,"Humalog works far better than my previous R insulin because it works more quickly. With R, I would inject just before a meal but would get post parandial highs that gave me a headache. It took 2.5 to 3 hours for R to start working. With Humalog, onset almost always cooincides with digestion so I get a better experience. I also end up with far fewer episodes of low blood sugar on Humalog than with R. My A1C has been in the low 6's since I started with Humalog where they had been in the low 7's with R. Read More Read Less  "
18,Humalog U-100 Insulin Subcutaneous,8/1/2010,45-54,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,5.0,5,5,5,"I use Humalog as a 'correction' medication.  Basically this means when my blood sugars are higher than usual, I bolus the dosage to bring levels back down.    My first time using it was last night when my 2 hour postprandial blood sugars jumped to 279. Within an hour after taking a shot, I dropped to 78. An hour and a half after that I was at 74.    I am EXTREMELY impressed as to how good this works for me. Only needed 3 units too.    Don't care for the 12mm needle. Will try the 8mm needle next time I am higher than usual.    I am hoping that between my diet and exercise, coupled with the Humalog, I can get even better blood sugars.    My last A1c about a week ago was 5.3, and that was with several spikes into the 200+ range, using diet and exercise alone. My goal is under 5.0 (4% club).    With this medication, I can vary my diet so it's not so boring, and not be forced to vigorously exercise as much to bring down blood sugars.    I am wondering something though:  Will I gain weight? Lose weight? Or maintain my weight when using any form of insulin?    Don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to 'paying the piper' (AKA exercising) after I eat. I have a lot of trouble fitting the needed time in to do it, and an even harder time getting back down to normal after a 200+ spike, using diet and exercise.    I generally have no trouble lowering my BS if I am 160-180 range, or less.    My fasting blood sugars are usually perfectly normal.    I can see some semblance of a life now that I have this medication. I won't do pills for my diabetes treatment as my blood sugars are usually well controlled. Seems heat & humidity (or a nap after eating) spikes me highly.    I really hope & pray that the endo will continue letting me have this medication.    I like it better than Humulin R which is slower.     Maybe get Humulin R for long digesting carbs like Dreamfields, and Humalog for the 'eat-N-go' carbs.

But, does it work? yes and very well with very good results. I was on this by my own request for 2 years and had a 110 mg/dl average consistent! Then something happened in my body and I had to raise up from the 50 units I had taken for over 2 years. I went slowly up to 94 units. There is where I stopped because for the first time in my Diabetic life, I found out what R can do and it scared me. I dropped fast! That 47 units of Humulin R in the 50/50 mix dropped me low quick and I didn't like that! So, I asked the doctor if I could go to N and R (vial of each) and that way go up a bit more with the N and go lower with the R and that has worked (for me). 50N/44R and I have to take Avandia 8mg. Yeah yeah, I know about the scare, but Avandia is the ONLY thing that works for me. Actos - ha ha what a joke! Same with Januvia (for me)  Read More Read Less  "

My two ways of using Afrezza are 1) to minimize after-meal spikes, which can be persistent, and 2) for occasions where my blood glucose is hanging at a high level.  Afrezza is much quicker to bring down the high -- sometimes down 100 points in 60-90 minutes instead of 3, 4, or 5 hours when I use Novolog through my pump.  Does it ""work"" every time?  No, but what diabetes control medication ever does?  For me, the quick onset, and relatively short time it takes for Afrezza to leave the body are major benefits.
I would recommend trying it.  Most users of Afrezza find that the ""conversion"" between Afrezza units and liquid insulin units is NOT 1:1, it is closer to 1.5:1 or 2:1 (so you'll need to take 4u of Afrezza to get the same effect as 2u  to 2.5u of Novolog/Humalog - 8u Afrezza inhaled to replace 5u Novolog/Humalog, etc)

I have been spending much more time in my target range and have had far fewer and less sever lows than when on just injections. I really like how fast I can bring down a high. Once I went to a potluck dinner, had to guess at carbs which I was way off, then got caught up in conversations and by the time I checked my blood sugar it had rocketed to 495. Yow! Took 8 units of Afrezza and 30 minutes later I had dropped to 128, all without overshooting and having a hypo. Love this stuff! Best insulin I have ever used.Read More Read Less  "

Lente human insulin (Novolin L, Humulin L) is available in vials.  Ultralente human insulin (Humulin U) is available in vials.    Insulin lispro (Humalog) is available in vials and cartridges.  Insulin aspart (Novolog) is available in vials and cartridges.    Insulin glargine (Lantus) is available in vials and cartridges.    STORAGE: Unopened insulin should be stored in a refrigerator between 2 and 8°C (36 and 46°F); it should not be placed in a freezer. Insulin vials that are being used can be kept at room temperature for up to a month. All vials should be protected from light and excessive heat. Unused insulin should be thrown away after the expiration date. The vials should never be shaken.    PRESCRIBED FOR: Insulin is prescribed for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.    DOSING: The abdomen is the preferred site for insulin injection, but the sites of injection must be rotated in order to prevent erosion of the fat beneath the skin, a condition called lipodystrophy.    DRUG INTERACTIONS: Several drugs augment the action of insulin and may lower blood glucose to a dangerous level (hypoglycemia). To prevent hypoglycemia when these drugs are used, the dose of insulin may need to be reduced. Such drugs include alcohol, MAO inhibitors like phenelzine (Nardil), beta-blockers like propranolol (Inderal), salicylates like aspirin (Bayer) or salsalate (Disalcid), and anabolic steroids like methyltestosterone (Android).    There are other drugs that augment the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin, but they are less likely to interact with insulin or have less of an effect. Such drugs include tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline (Vibramycin), guanethidine (Ismelin), oral hypoglycemic drugs like glyburide (Diabeta), sulfa antibiotics like sulfadiazine, and ACE inhibitors like captopril (Capoten).    There also are drugs that decrease the effect of insulin. Read More Read Less  "

I don't work anymore so it was easy for me to just stay at home and lay down in the bed. If I couldn't tolerate it I would have ask the dr. for something else I have been on this medication for four months. No one showed me how to use this medicine and some times it didn't go in and it rand ran down my stomach after re-reading the instructions I learned how to use the pen correctly Now I have to remember to eat a evening snack sometimes my glucose will drop low around 5 or 6 am and I have to get something right away. so I drink a cup of milk while I am fixing my breakfast.

I've been on it for about three weeks with no lows - just excellent BG readings.  My insulin needs have also dropped by about a third.  And instead of split doses, my basal with Tresiba is now once a day in the AM. My doctor and I are both delighted with the results I have been having.  I'm using the U-100, and the newly designed pens are far above any others I've handled.  My biggest concern in the beginning was how would it be to work with a 42 hour insulin.  I would suggest reading Novo's full information on Tresiba before converting, because it does address this issue.  But switching over for me was actually very easy.  One important note in their info was that it takes 8 days for Tresiba to reach it's full potential, so  any increases have to be made slowly. I've only had to increase my initial dose by two units, one time, and at this point I believe I'm right on target.  My morning blood sugars are the kind I used to only dream about! :-) I hope more people are given the opportunity to try Tresiba.  As far as the rumors of sky high cost is concerned, the Humalog pens I buy are actually more expensive than the Tresiba!  So, don't believe every rumor you read.  Talk to Novo, and talk to folks that are using Tresiba if you want to know how what it's really all about.  My father had Type 1 diabetes most of his life, and his parents told him that in his life time there would probably a cure.  I've had Type 1 most of my life, and my parents told me that in my life time there would probably be a cure.  Well, I don't see 'the cure' happening any time soon, but until then for me Tresiba is about as close to 'a cure' as you can get. IMHO of course.Read More Read Less  "

I liked levimir over Lantus because of the way Lantus burns.  My doc said this is a 48 hour insulin, yeah right, lol.  My sugar rises crazy in the mornings, way worse than ever on levimir.  I turned to taking a short acting corrective dose in the morning since being on tresiba.  Itâ??s so confusing, I figured a 48 hour insulin would be better at keeping a stable blood sugar for an extended period. This morning issue led me to start taking some humulinN in the am because the peak is just right to bring down the rise while taking tresiba.  Then I take a dose of tresiba in the evening which then holds over. My overall baseline dose amount is the same as when only taking levimir, but the blood sugar is better overall with this combo.  But tresiba by itself sucked.Read More Read Less  "

My evening insulin wasn't lasting nearly long enough. Then there were the peaks and valleys. I switched to Semglee and it was a total game changer. Completely steady activity for 24 hours. Used with the Libre 2 things become much easier to manage. As far as all of the complaints of ineffectiveness and weight gain, I have not had those issues. I'm very active and fit. I hike, I bike, and run. Something every day. Cannot speak for others but it works well for me.
The biggest change for me making the switch was that because it is so long-lasting and steady I became much more sensitive to my fast acting insulin. prior to Semglee there were times my fast acting had to make up the waning activity of my basal insulin. Now i'm very sensitive to the fast acting and I love it.Read More Read Less  "

Always very controlled on Lantus for many years. Insurance company also switched me to Semglee. I also have experienced unexplained weight gain (exercise almost daily and watch what I eat).

It is now 8.8 with no changes in my diet. I also have to inject 50 units instead of the 30 i was on with Lantus.

550,Semglee U-100 Insulin Subcutaneous,4/6/2023,45-54,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Diabetes,1.3,1,2,1,"I am likely a type 1 that was misdiagnosed as a type 2 years ago (TL;DR I had a suspected (suspected by my Endo) autoimmune episode at 22 yo that destroyed 60-70% of my beta cells.) I had just enough insulin to not go DKA but to not have good control either. MD didn’t do peptide/antibody because there was “no way I was Type1 because I was 26 so bring on Type 2 meds that never really worked right…of course that was totally lack of willpower said my MDs.  I ran 23 years on a mix of every med under the sun and occasional long-acting insulin.  I have had dawn phenomena the whole time which most of my MDs told me was impossible and a figment of my imagination. The Dexcom finally showed it was real and they admitted I might be a type 1.5. 

They supercharged my poor betas with meds and they did the best they could. My beta cells (what was left of them) finally gave up the ghost about 6 weeks ago, according to tests, and I ended up in DKA.  

I responded AWESOMELY to 30 units of IV insulin and m/l 15 units of sliding scale while in the ICU for 6 days.  I was taken off the drip 4 days in and put on 24 units of Lantus (14 AM, 10 PM) with Humalog for sliding scale 4Xs daily.  My control was nice and solid (130 averages).  I was sent home with 1.5 pens of Lantus and used for the first 15 days home.  Control wasn’t hard and my AGP (Dexcom G6) over 14 days was 6.2!!  Express Scripts wouldn’t cover Lantus (I hate our profit driven healthcare system)…I was told Semglee was biosimilar and a 1:1 replacement.  Not even close.  My control is a nightmare on 65 units (35 AM 30PM). It takes 30-40U, over several injections, of Humalog to keep me averaging 160ish.  It’s almost like the Semglee isn’t there at all. Thank God my Omnipod5 training is TOMORROW and I take my last garbage shot of Semglee at 7pm tonight.  I respond great to fast acting and will be solely on Humalog from here on out. 

I have reached out to my PCP and Endo and advocated for any other patients on this garbage.  Express Scripts will allow Lantus IF your MD will go to bat and say it’s not working.  Prior Authorization is possible.  Advocate for yourself and fight for your health!  Get back on Lantus or get on a pump (that’s not hard either…get with a diabetes pharmacist (mine is at my local med center) and they will help you navigate Express Scripts.). Be persistent and ask your MD to truly advocate for you.  You deserve a med that works!  Good Luck to you all.  Maybe someday big pharma and the insurance companies will care about the patient first.  I keep praying for that day to come…JoeRead More Read Less  "

I'm about to contact my Dr about this as well. I was completely controlled on Lantus, and have used both as I still had some Lantus left. My glucose levels are FAR more controlled with Lantus.  My levels were significantly elevated with Semglee and I can't increase the dose any more without fear of more severe hypoglycemia. I can't pinpoint the ""peak"" either (which every glargine has - though slight - it has to be accounted for in your control).  This is not an equal product. With insurance not covering my Lantus anymore I don't know what to do. Managed care in this country is a business, and cares nothing about anyones ""health"".  It's shameful and a tragedy that I have to fight for my health in this country.  I wish the insurance companies would have to turn their bodies in to experimental lab rats as they keep making us do every time they decide not to cover an insulin based on their business and political dealings. I work really hard at being healthy and staying well with Diabetes, and every time I have to try something else due to financial/managed care/political reasons it just undoes all the work we do to stay alive.

I never had a problem with Humalog turning cloudy but in the past few months I have had to throw away 3 bottles of Novolog because they turned cloudy in the bottle. I am on an insulin pump and I change tubing every 3 days. The last bottle of Novolog I opened I filled the insulin pump one time and 3 days later when I went to fill it again the insulin was cloudy. The Novolog had an expiration date of 12/2014 and is control # BZF0540. The insulin is fine when stored in the refrigerator but I carry it in my pocket in a plastic case made for that purpose. I fill my pump 4 times from a bottle which should equate to about 12 days of use from one 10ml. bottle of Novolog and it is turning cloudy after 1 or 2 uses causing a lot of waste. I keep unused bottles in the refrigerator and 1 bottle at room temperature. This product is inferior to Humalog and I don't like insurance companies dictating which products I can and cannot use as peoples lives are at stake. I also have had days of high blood sugar until I figured out the insulin had turned cloudy and was no longer effective. What good is an insulin that only lasts a few days at room temperature? My doctor tells me she only uses Novolog when treating patients in the hospital and that Humalog and Novolog are basically identical but I suggest in a hospital setting temperature is more controlled and there are fewer variables than when 1 person uses 1 bottle until empty.

The only side effect I have noticed is the extreme weight gain, which I find at 51yrs old is extremly hard to lose.  I have gained over 7yrs on these two insulins about 70lbs. I have even tried Phentermine to help me lose the weight, but it only briefly worked, I have to come off of it for a while, then go back on it for a while for it to have any effect, however the effect is minimal.  I have also since being on both insulins had High Blood Pressure, and High Cholesterol, my Cholesterol has come down, but my good cholesterol is low.  My blood pressure is good for periods at a time, and high sometimes. Although I rate these two insulins High, I wish that the weight gain was not so severe, I feel if the weight gain were lowered dramatically, I would feel far more energetic, and my blood pressure and cholesterol would also become nearer normal.  I would also probably find the Phentermine would work more effectively, and I would be able to stick to a more healthier diet. Read More Read Less  "

I can never seem to get the pen needles to thread correctly on the pen and the whole thing feels incredibly cheap with very poor allowances. From observation it appears the first unit of each injection is less than a full dose compared to the second or third units in an injection and the poor manufacturing allowances just make for a product that feels cheap, sloppy, and inaccurate. The difficulties in threading the pen needle alone are aggravating enough, but right now I'm locked into this particular brand thanks to insurance (which I have an entirely different tirade about). Everything just feels so loose and cheap and frustrates me every time I have to correct my sugars.Read More Read Less  "

I have been told by several 80-200 then, 80-120 mg./ dL. is the correct range.  It is due to the time when they went to Medical School.

Today I still use Novolin N once at night at 15units and Novolin R bolus as needed- 3-7 units/ bolus 2x/day.

My insurance made me change to Novolog and i have had my sugar too high. I found that the pens are defective and not giving the dosage you adjust it for. I have sent back 4 pens to caremark and have 2 more bad ones. The defects i found were the pens leak so your not getting the full injection and the gear drives in them have not pushed the plunger down which reduces the dosage.

There is a learning curve associated with using Afrezza.  It took me about three months to figure out how exactly to configure the back of my throat, flatten out the back of my tongue and inhale at the correct rate.  Also, after inhaling I found it's a good idea to exhale through my nose just in case there is any excess powder left over that didn't get into my lungs (it's possible that may have a side benefit by getting insulin into the nasal cavity and slowing long term cognitive decline - JMHO.)    At any rate when I got my blood test results in May,  my A1C had dropped from 8.7 to 7.9 and that was while I was still trying to figure out how to use the device.

I have repeatedly been assured that Levemir has nothing to do with it, and I was beginning to think something was seriously wrong with me. My blood sugars have reached more than 500 several times, which never happened in 15 years that I took Lantus. I have gained 10 pounds, lost all motivation, felt weak in my  muscles and tired. I have decreased my caloric intake and increased my activity, including lifting weights three times a week, and still I cannot lose weight. I am curious to see my A1c results this week.

She had samples of Leveimir and in the 3 weeks I've been on it my sugars have dropped from 348 average down to 130. I'm not sleepy all the time. I've been watching what I eat and excising too.   With just using Metformin it didn't seem to matter I would watch what I eat and workout some and it would rarely go below 200. So I just gave up and started eating what I wanted and didn't check my sugars. FOR ONCE I'm on track. I do have to go talk to the Dr about the rash that's developed on my arm.

1009,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/24/2023,,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Diabetes,1.0,1,1,1,"The Levemir FlexPen update/Improvement is a total disaster.
The ""New"" look for the FlexPen is extremely difficult to work with.
You have to use both hands to accomplish an injection, instead of the easy dial, one handed operation and auto injection of the old Pen.
Reduces the amount of injection sites available due to two handed operation.
Needles get bent 
Exteme care must be used while injecting otherwise you tear the skin and requires more than one injection
Only sixty units can be obtained per use requiring more than one injection.
The injector pad must be strongly pressed to dispense the insulin, causing bent needles, pen coming loose, wasting insulin, damaging the injection site, tearing of skin at injection site, and other issues.

This update was obvious to increase sales and reduce cost. 
Novo Nordisk obviously did not test their product and they surely did not test with actual diabetics otherwise they never would have developed this piece of dung.  Profits override customers.

The ""New"" look for the FlexPen is extremely difficult to work with.
You have to use both hands to accomplish an injection, instead of the easy dial, one handed operation and auto injection of the old Pen.
Reduces the amount of injection sites available due to two handed operation.
Needles get bent 
Exteme care must be used while injecting otherwise you tear the skin and requires more than one injection
Only sixty units can be obtained per use requiring more than one injection.
The injector pad must be strongly pressed to dispense the insulin, causing bent needles, pen coming loose, wasting insulin, damaging the injection site, tearing of skin at injection site, and other issues.

This update was obvious to increase sales and reduce cost. 
Novo Nordisk obviously did not test their product and they surely did not test with actual diabetics otherwise they never would have developed this piece of dung.  Profits override customers.

1089,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/24/2023,,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Diabetes,1.0,1,1,1,"The Levemir FlexPen update/Improvement is a total disaster.
The ""New"" look for the FlexPen is extremely difficult to work with.
You have to use both hands to accomplish an injection, instead of the easy dial, one handed operation and auto injection of the old Pen.
Reduces the amount of injection sites available due to two handed operation.
Needles get bent 
Exteme care must be used while injecting otherwise you tear the skin and requires more than one injection
Only sixty units can be obtained per use requiring more than one injection.
The injector pad must be strongly pressed to dispense the insulin, causing bent needles, pen coming loose, wasting insulin, damaging the injection site, tearing of skin at injection site, and other issues.

This update was obvious to increase sales and reduce cost. 
Novo Nordisk obviously did not test their product and they surely did not test with actual diabetics otherwise they never would have developed this piece of dung.  Profits override customers.

1149,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/24/2023,,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Diabetes,1.0,1,1,1,"The Levemir FlexPen update/Improvement is a total disaster.
The ""New"" look for the FlexPen is extremely difficult to work with.
You have to use both hands to accomplish an injection, instead of the easy dial, one handed operation and auto injection of the old Pen.
Reduces the amount of injection sites available due to two handed operation.
Needles get bent 
Exteme care must be used while injecting otherwise you tear the skin and requires more than one injection
Only sixty units can be obtained per use requiring more than one injection.
The injector pad must be strongly pressed to dispense the insulin, causing bent needles, pen coming loose, wasting insulin, damaging the injection site, tearing of skin at injection site, and other issues.

This update was obvious to increase sales and reduce cost. 
Novo Nordisk obviously did not test their product and they surely did not test with actual diabetics otherwise they never would have developed this piece of dung.  Profits override customers.

My insulin does not seem to work as well using the new Levemir FlexPens!  Have the ingredients also been changed to make the company more profitable?"
1206,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,11/23/2023,,Male,10 years or more,Patient,Diabetes,2.0,3,1,2,Just another company cheating out on there product to make money!  Guess they are saving money on springs! Sort of like the potato chip bags being half full of air. There is no way a diabetic with weak hands can now use this product successfully!  The Levemir FlexPen is now no more than a poorly functioning glorified syringe! Went from good to bad overnight!
1207,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,11/6/2023,55-64,Female,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.3,5,1,1,Since they discontinued the FlexTouch pen it has been a nightmare. My hands shake as I try to inject the medication and the needle bends!!!!
1208,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,11/2/2023,,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1.0,1,1,1,"This new pen is junk.   It is poorly designed.  I wish the people who had designed it actually used it.  Then they would know how difficult it is to use.   This new design requires me to use two hands in order to use it. I have had pain at the ejection site, causing bleeding and bruising.  Being a diabetic everyone of these symptoms is bad bad bad for me.   I am now in the process of looking for another company who offers a spring loaded mechanism design.  The FlexTouch worked for me, the FlexPen does not.  Profit over customer. Poor business decision.Read More Read Less  "
1209,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/24/2023,,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Diabetes,1.0,1,1,1,"The Levemir FlexPen update/Improvement is a total disaster.
The ""New"" look for the FlexPen is extremely difficult to work with.
You have to use both hands to accomplish an injection, instead of the easy dial, one handed operation and auto injection of the old Pen.
Reduces the amount of injection sites available due to two handed operation.
Needles get bent 
Exteme care must be used while injecting otherwise you tear the skin and requires more than one injection
Only sixty units can be obtained per use requiring more than one injection.
The injector pad must be strongly pressed to dispense the insulin, causing bent needles, pen coming loose, wasting insulin, damaging the injection site, tearing of skin at injection site, and other issues.

This update was obvious to increase sales and reduce cost. 
Novo Nordisk obviously did not test their product and they surely did not test with actual diabetics otherwise they never would have developed this piece of dung.  Profits override customers.

1210,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/17/2023,55-64,Female,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.3,5,1,1,Very hard to dispense with one hand on pen.  The pen moves and causes damage  to my body while dispensing. It only dispenses 60. Must use two needles per use. The Flex touch was much more firm. 
1211,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/17/2023,35-44,Female,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Diabetes,2.0,4,1,1,"The new pen is terrible, very difficult to use and painful. You have to use too much force to inject."
1212,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/15/2023,65-74,Male,5 to less than 10 years,Patient,Diabetes,2.0,4,1,1,The new design of the pen is horrible
1213,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/12/2023,45-54,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,1.0,1,1,1,It bends the needles every time I use it and I do not get the proper dose. The Flextouch actually worked way better. I don't know what to do. 
1214,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/10/2023,65-74,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.0,4,1,1,"The new pen design is horrible. Can’t use just one hand any more. You usually need to use larger doses of levemir than Humalog which means you dial the plunger out much farther therefore it’s much more difficult to use because it is not a smooth operation of the plunger. 
At times it stops and you have to restock yourself to finish the dose. Horrible design!

1215,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,10/8/2023,65-74,Female,1 to less than 2 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.0,3,1,2,Since switching to this pen when I turn to choose the dose there is no click and when it's time to administer the dose I can't push the button at the end of the pen I have to manually turn the pen back to zero in order to give myself my dosage and I don't think this is the way it's supposed to work I'm very disappointed and I will be letting my doctor know about this I'm not comfortable with this new type of pen
1216,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,9/25/2023,65-74,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,2.7,4,1,3,I have been using Levimere for years. The previous pen was great as you only had to push the button and it injected the insulin. This new pen requires two hands and it is extremely difficult to inject the insulin. I have bent the needle many times.
1217,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,9/23/2023,,Male,10 years or more,Patient,Diabetes,4.3,5,5,3,"Medicine works fine, but ""new"" method of injection is terrible. I sometimes have to inject 60mg
and with use of only one hand this is very difficult with the new flex pen. "
1218,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,9/20/2023,65-74,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Diabetes,1.3,2,1,1,The new FlexPen is awful. Very hard to dispense and sugar levels have went up since the switch so I dont think the full amount of insulin is getting injected 
1219,Levemir Flexpen Subcutaneous,9/19/2023,,Female,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,1.0,1,1,1,"I was using FlexTouch pen! It is very easy to use! I HATE THE Levemir FLEXPEN. It so HARD to
Push the button to inject the insulin! Have hurt myself many times from pen moving around. Bring back FlexTouch. Oh, also, my glucose is higher. They claim the insulin is the same, but I have my doubts. Black if the box has slightly different contents listed. I will definitely be looking for a different insulin. I can’t push this button easily. Too painful. "
