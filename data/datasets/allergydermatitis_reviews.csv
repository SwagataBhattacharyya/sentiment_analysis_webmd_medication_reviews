After 6-7 months, in desperation, I tried Cortaid twice a day after I wash my face. It has only been a few days but most of the pussiness and resultant crusty scales are gone and the red areas are slowly improving. I would never have used this product for my problem if I had read your article first because you specifically say NOT to use it on the face! Then under conditions treated by the product you list a facial condition. Please reconcile these conflicting statements. Why did you say don't use it on the face? What sort of things might happen? I want my face to clear up but I don't want to cause some disfiguration either!Read More Read Less  "

The dermatologist I saw recommended Triamcinolone cream be applied daily for 2 weeks followed by CeraVe cream for 2 weeks. The Triamcinolone indeed caused the itchiness to recede however within a few days the itchiness did return with the discontinued use. A second round of application was recommended with the very same results. The Triamcinolone was only able to put the problem in check for a limited time. Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation. In short, and in my experience, the very expensive Triamcinolone was scantly better than the anti-itch products available over the counter.Read More Read Less  "

That was about a month ago.  Ever since, I've had bizarre side effects including:  worsening ear infection (dx'ed ""Swimmer's Ear"" by doctor), dry itchy scalp + hair loss, white peach fuzz growth on my face(!), severe bloating, stretch marks that weren't there before & increasingly dry skin around my nose/mouth.

They were so sensitive I could not eat, and even drinking through a straw was painful. I returned to the dermatologist who explained this was reaction not unusual and that I'd need to keep using it until my skin was ""adjusted"" to it. I, of course, declined. He did prescribe a steroidally based remedy which I applied several times daily so my lips returned to normal after another week. I regard this as a dangerous medication, however helpful it may be, that requires great care in usage.

The Triamcinolone indeed caused the itchiness to recede however within a few days the itchiness did return with the discontinued use. A second round of application was recommended with the very same results. The Triamcinolone was only able to put the problem in check for a limited time. Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation.

I returned to the dermatologist who explained this was reaction not unusual and that I'd need to keep using it until my skin was ""adjusted"" to it. I, of course, declined.

The Triamcinolone indeed caused the itchiness to recede however within a few days the itchiness did return with the discontinued use. A second round of application was recommended with the very same results. The Triamcinolone was only able to put the problem in check for a limited time. Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation.

Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation.

They were so sensitive I could not eat, and even drinking through a straw was painful. I returned to the dermatologist who explained this was reaction not unusual and that I'd need to keep using it until my skin was ""adjusted"" to it. I, of course, declined.

Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation.

That was about a month ago.

After about 4 days, my lips started turning blue. I discontinued using it. However, over the next few days my lips turned black and the skin-- ALL the skin-- began peeling away, until I was left with barely one layer on red/black lips that seeped blood constantly. They were so sensitive I could not eat, and even drinking through a straw was painful. I returned to the dermatologist who explained this was reaction not unusual and that I'd need to keep using it until my skin was ""adjusted"" to it. I, of course, declined. He did prescribe a steroidally based remedy which I applied several times daily so my lips returned to normal after another week. I regard this as a dangerous medication, however helpful it may be, that requires great care in usage. I recommend anyone, when starting out using it, to apply it sparingly for a few hours a day at first before any greater application, regardless of a doctor's usage recommendation.Read More Read Less  "

The dermatologist I saw recommended Triamcinolone cream be applied daily for 2 weeks followed by CeraVe cream for 2 weeks. The Triamcinolone indeed caused the itchiness to recede however within a few days the itchiness did return with the discontinued use. A second round of application was recommended with the very same results. The Triamcinolone was only able to put the problem in check for a limited time. Essentially, the product was able to have an effect on the symptom but did not address the actual cause of the problem. In a follow-up visit the dermatologist recommended another topical ointment reminiscent of petroleum jelly only much thicker, I do not remember the name of the drug, which had no effect on the symptom or cause. When I suggested the possibility of something dietary or environmental, even though nothing had changed in my diet or environment, the dermatologist quickly suggested seeing an allergist for further evaluation into the possible causation. In short, and in my experience, the very expensive Triamcinolone was scantly better than the anti-itch products available over the counter.Read More Read Less  "

I realize that this cream doesn’t work for me anymore just because my eczema is now spreading in places. I’ve never had it before, so I have chose to moderately withdraw from the steroid and heal my skin holistically
Side effects
Swelling
Stinging
Burning
Itching
Shivering
Fatigue
Flakiness
Of course, while stopping steroid cream, these common symptoms will happen first thing to do for mental health purposes and physical purposes, to find what comes and collects you well withdrawing from the steroid
Everything about eczema is trial and error so and just what you prefer
In hindsight, I wish I never started steroid cream. I wish my doctor prescribe some thing a little less overall, this cream works very well
But I do not recommend extensive use over long periods of time maybe 12 months Max

This website advises that Glaucoma  can result from this steriod medication if you get it in your eye. While I don’t recall that happening I also can’t be sure that I washed my hands as directed every time after applying the topical steroid.   My eye doctor asked me if I had been taking any steroids, and I said no because I wasn’t taking any by mouth but have been using this topical cream For the last month,and forgot to tell him about it. I have alerted him now and have stopped taking the medication until my next pressure check in my right eye in six weeks. Beware! Read More Read Less  "

The itching was so intense I could not control or resist myself from scratching, also hot water felt so good in the shower leaving my arms and the scabs pink moist and raw yet it was sooo damn soothing. It almost appeared as if I had some form of fleswh eating disease was my visual impression.Then a friend gave me Fluocinide and I say witin 7-10 days the scabs all I desribed symtoms vanished and I say 2-3 weeks my arms were normal like nothing had been there , miracle, until I ran out and slowly all symtoms and inflammations began to reappear til I could find more of the creme. So for the last 15 years Fluoicnide has been my only known way of never ridding myself of whatever this disease is just controlling an all out explosion again.

That sounds worse then it is but I have it through out my body in circles sized from about a ball point pen to the size of a half dollar maybe a little larger. I have a hard time/lazyness and I do not take it the way I should. But when I am having a lot of itching and I do remember to put it on my scalp it is instant relief. It is not that my psoriasis is not bothersome it is just that I also have a hard time finding all the spots to apply the medication is hard to do on my own. But I hope that the next person to use this product wil work for them . I am satisifed with it except it makes my hair very oily so when I do put it on I have to make sure I am not going anywhere or I am going to look like I do not shower... lol... so good luck to anyone.

But if it also can cause my dermatitis to spread if it comes in contact with skin.  And actually this last flare up has resulted in it really getting red and blistered more than what it originally was.    It also takes two weeks for it to go away but this time it hasn't gone away.  Often times the dermatitis will go away for two weeks and come back.  This is in the winter.  Sumner I usually dont have dermatitis.  I'm not sure what ti do as it doesnt make sense that it always come back.  And never heals.  I've had it for six years.  I have no reaction to contact dermatitis on any other part of my body.  It was only on one leg for six years.  This winter it came out on my other leg which has never happened before ever.  Its wierd.  I said to my doctor maybe I'm having to use a communal laundry and that could be the problem. Read More Read Less

You see I know exactly how well medication works and I can tell you if my skin has become immune to it within days / hours of trying it. I had said to my doctor that the hydrocortizone cream was not doing any good at all as all it was effectively doing was 'nothing' as my skin has become immune to it.  He replied excuse me I'm your doctor I think I would know if your skin has become immune to it.  So, when we were at the dermatologists' she asked me about it and I repeated what I had told my doctor days after starting the hydrocortizone. She asked my mum how he reacted and she told her. The dermatologist was really nice and asked to see a written account in a weeks time but I gave her my diary and she had seen all my accounts I had made within the past 8 months.  She came to lunch with us reading through my accounts and asking me more questions then she agreed with what I'd been saying all along and gave me ELOCON to try.  After 2 hours of starting it my skin was already closing up.  I was amazed. My mother even took photos every hour to show the 'COCKY' doctor.  Within a week it had miraculously improved.  Now I use Elocon 1 every day at the most and my skin looks pretty good.

These are the areas that tend to flair up the most. Sometimes it will flare up around the sides of my mouth, so I apply it there too. I do find that if I apply it to the inside of my ears everyday I get these pimples like from having to much grease on the skin. This problem doesn't seem to happen on my face. My doctor prescribed it for my ears but I tried it on my face one night because I couldn't take the itching anymore and it responded to the medication. HELPFUL TIP!!! The best way I have found to apply to the inside of the ear is to squeeze the ointment onto the tip of a cotton swab (Q-TIP) and slightly stick it inside the ear end turn it around so that it gets applied to all areas inside of the ear. MY doctor told me to never stop using this medicine. HOPE THIS INFORMATION IS HELPFUL TO SOMEONE.Read More Read Less  "
986,Aristocort A Topical,6/16/2011,45-54,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Contact Dermatitis,5.0,5,5,5,This was prescribed to relieve irritation and rash due to poison ivy. The medication is extremely effective and it cleared up the blisters within two days. Typically it takes about 1-2 weeks for me to see/feel any results when I get poison ivy. This is a fast acting medication! I have never had such a positive result in such a short time.

990,Ultravate Topical,2/7/2013,45-54,Male,2 to less than 5 years,Patient,Plaque Psoriasis,5.0,5,5,5,"Ultravate made a noticeable improvement in my psoriasis in just 2-days, and cleared small spots in 3-days.     The product does not smell. It has a consistency like a clear Vaseline Petroleum Jelly, so it is best to apply it during the day, because it will come off on your sheets at night. It does not stain fabric.     I have only tried it for a couple days on larger spots; spots larger than 2-inches wide and on thicker spots on my elbows, and it did not make a noticeable difference on them in that short a time. I did not try it longer on  the large spots, because it is uses up so much of my limited supply.    I have experienced great success treating large spots with the ultra-violet light machine at my dermatologist. You can even get a prescription to buy your own machine. The machine is like a stand-up 3-sided tanning booth. You go in in your underwear for 10-seconds, and over several weeks work your way up to a couple minutes. It cleared all my psoriasis completely, and I had it everywhere. Unfortunately, my psoriasis came back because I have several old spinal injuries that will not heal and which cause my psoriasis to flare. It is hard to find a dermatologist that uses the machine. You can buy a full size machine or a small desk-top model that you can just fit an arm or leg under. I am not sure exactly how the machine works. I think the machine emits a certain band of ultraviolet light that is concentrated. I know it is not the same light as sun-bathing, and I think the light is different than that from a tanning-booth; though it looks the same. You have to wear goggles, and build-up slowly or you can get a sunburn. I never had problem and I have very light and sensitive skin.Read More Read Less  "

I was not very impressed with its efficacy.  Applying it twice a day & wearing socks year-round was not pleasant for a woman in the professional field, but I was told that it was the best option for my condition.  The condition never cleared up & worsened each time that I missed an application.  I now have a new MD recommending other options- Vectical, Clobex and laser-light therapy.

Never had a prob with it and it really made my anxiety and quality of life better and much more able to partake in working at therapy.  So my psychiatrist changed locations to another state, so was referred to another practice.  I waited two months for an appt.  New Psych said I don't prescribe benzos so for your anxiety I'm going to give you this awesome alternative that works for many of my anxious patients.  Going to the pharmacy to pick it up there was some mixup at the pharmacy and the pharmacist had to call the dr.  The dr. revealed that she did send it over and that she's been sending over prescriptions for this medication all day for other patients with no problem.  A red flag went up then.

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person.

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person.

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person.

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person. I’ve only taken this drug 3 times (not even in a row) and will not be taking it again. Read More Read Less  "

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person.

I'm petrified of gaining weight, but yet, the benefits of Vistaril have been great. I don't see my pdoc until February 15th.

I'm petrified of gaining weight, but yet, the benefits of Vistaril have been great. I don't see my pdoc until February 15th.

My doctor prescribed me this medication as I expressed I had lots of anxiety while trying to sleep and it caused me to not be able to fall asleep most nights. I was getting around ~5 hours of sleep and with Vistaril I am now getting ~3 hours. It makes you feel drowsy, don’t get me wrong, and relaxes your muscles, but not in a way that is helpful. I felt like I was trapped inside a zombies body. Falling asleep on this drug is extremely difficult. My body is uncomfortable and feels numb. I wake up several times during the night and the next morning I don’t know if I was asleep or awake during the night. I can only remember staring at the window for what seemed like hours. I feel the side effects of this drug a whole 24 hours after taking it. The next morning after taking it for sleep, my muscles do not work properly and I feel as though I’ve lost motor function in my limbs and fingers. My brain is not comprehending information quickly and I have a hard time typing and reading, which is most of my job. Even reaching up to open my car door is a chore for my body. I was in a store and felt like I had to be taken to emergency because of how much anxiety I was feeling coupled with my body feeling limp and weak. Everything about this medication effected me negatively. Didn’t help with my anxiety. Didn’t help me fall asleep. Just made me feel like an empty shell of a person.

1832,Vistaril Oral,2/16/2018,35-44,,1 to 6 months,Patient,Additional Medication for Calming,5.0,5,5,5,I was prescribed this med to help me fall asleep as well as allergies. I have noticed a welcoming- calming effect that is not too sedative- very quick onset. I have had no issues such as side effects or anything to report unpleasant. Very happy that this med was added to my daily regimen of medications. It makes me feel focused. Bonus!

Hydrocodone makes me vomit, so doc though Vistaril would help me tolerate the Demerol. Within an hour of taking it my blood pressure dropped super low and I fainted 3 times within a hour. I hadn't taken the Demerol yet, so it wasn't the 2 drugs interacting. Had to go to the ER and have IV fluid to flush it out. I would NOT recommend this drug if you have low BP. Mine is 80/65 normally."

Originally, the Vistaril was a low dose, so there wasn't any noticeable weight gain, but I also wasn't getting any relief from my symptoms.  On January 6, 2017, my pdoc increased my dosage to 50 mg. up to 3 times per day.  I am now getting relief from my symptoms, but I also notice the scale creeping upwards.  This upsets and frustrates me becsuse since August 1, 2016, I have worked hard to lose 30 pounds and I'm petrified of that slipping away.  I just don't know what to do.  I'm petrified of gaining weight, but yet, the benefits of Vistaril have been great. I don't see my pdoc until February 15th.  I guess I'll have to wait to discuss this then, because the doctors don't answer non life threatening questions when they see that you have an appointment coming up.Read More Read Less  "

I was taking it every day several times a day at the same times every day. It really didn't have a decent affect after taking it for about 6 months. They increased the dose by adding that I could also take it PRN. Soon I discovered that it was not working too well about 6 months later. My new prescribing physician let me know that taking Vistaril every day at the same time of day was not as effective as just taking it PRN.

The burn had healed well, but then he developed shingles in the affected area.  We live in a remote area and had already made the trip to town for diagnosis.  Whatever was prescribed was not helping our son at all.  It was desperation that made me grab the Topsyn that had worked so well on our other son's poison ivy outbreak.  Not only did our young son find immediate relief, the shingles were gone within a few days and NEVER returned.  I am aware of two other instances in which the same results were achieved on cases of shingles.  One case was my dad, who had suffered with the condition for over a year before I learned he had it.  I insisted that he use the Topsyn.  He was so glad he did.  The other instance was the son of a good friend.  This young man had shingles appear on his face shortly before he was scheduled for his Senior graduation pictures to be taken.  They were desperate, used the Topsyn, had the rash disappear, and it never returned.  I have mentioned this to various doctors through the years, but have always been the recipient of a rather disinterested response.  Whatever can be done to promote this use of Topsyn would be appreciated by so many sufferers of Shingles.  Please get the word out!Read More Read Less  "

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days.

I also have panic attacks and feelings at times of negative thoughts and feelings of being unsafe. I talked with my psychiatrist, and I even suggested a Benzo, she immediately dismissed it. She said told me the last thing she wanted to give any medication starting off that could have major side effects. So she prescribed me this. I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water.

I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me. Or I might only take half a pill. Overall it does help with anxiety though. Just weird side effects Read More Read Less

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days.

I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water.

I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me. Or I might only take half a pill. Overall it does help with anxiety though. Just weird side effects Read More Read Less

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days. Any more than that and I can't keep my eyes open, but everyone's tolerance level is different. 50mg is perfect for me to help me get to sleep. Read More Read Less  "

I also have panic attacks and feelings at times of negative thoughts and feelings of being unsafe. I talked with my psychiatrist, and I even suggested a Benzo, she immediately dismissed it. She said told me the last thing she wanted to give any medication starting off that could have major side effects. So she prescribed me this. I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water.

I enjoy life and I have a lot of energy. I just get overwhelmed.  She prescribed this medication and it works wonders. She said I can take it twice a day but I only take it at night before bed.

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days. Any more than that and I can't keep my eyes open, but everyone's tolerance level is different. 50mg is perfect for me to help me get to sleep. Read More Read Less  "

I also have panic attacks and feelings at times of negative thoughts and feelings of being unsafe. I talked with my psychiatrist, and I even suggested a Benzo, she immediately dismissed it. She said told me the last thing she wanted to give any medication starting off that could have major side effects. So she prescribed me this. I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water.

He had no problem prescribing 1 mg of Klonopin 2 times per day.  I came back a month later and I told him how much different it made in my life.  I am not addicted, but feel really    functional again.  His final words on Visteral was "" I never prescribe that in my practice.

I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me.

I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me. Or I might only take half a pill. Overall it does help with anxiety though. Just weird side effects Read More Read Less

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days.

I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water.

I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me. Or I might only take half a pill. Overall it does help with anxiety though. Just weird side effects Read More Read Less

No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days. Any more than that and I can't keep my eyes open, but everyone's tolerance level is different. 50mg is perfect for me to help me get to sleep. Read More Read Less  "

I also have panic attacks and feelings at times of negative thoughts and feelings of being unsafe. I talked with my psychiatrist, and I even suggested a Benzo, she immediately dismissed it. She said told me the last thing she wanted to give any medication starting off that could have major side effects. So she prescribed me this. I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water. Plus I’ve gotten my appetite back. Hope this helps. Read More Read Less  "

I couldn’t get it under control. I couldn’t sleep at night, overthinking.  I told my doctor about it and that I didn’t want anything for depression.  I am not depressed. I enjoy life and I have a lot of energy. I just get overwhelmed.  She prescribed this medication and it works wonders. She said I can take it twice a day but I only take it at night before bed.  It relaxes me and I sleep well.  I am also calmer during the day.  "

2146,Hydroxyzine Pamoate Oral,5/3/2023,35-44,Female,less than 1 month,Patient,Anxious,4.0,4,4,4,"Like many other people have said here, taking Hydroxyzine for anxiety is very different from taking a benzo like Valium / Xanax. No, it's not going to give you a *euphoric* calm like those, but it's also not addictive and you won't quickly build a tolerance. It does definitely relax me and helps me sleep. I wish there was a healthy and natural way to get that Xanax-like calm (if you've taken it, you know what I mean), but this is a much safer alternative, so I suggest giving it a shot. Btw, I only take 25mg during the day to take the edge off stressful work days. Any more than that and I can't keep my eyes open, but everyone's tolerance level is different. 50mg is perfect for me to help me get to sleep. Read More Read Less  "
2147,Hydroxyzine Pamoate Oral,1/14/2023,25-34,Male,less than 1 month,Patient,Inducing of a Relaxed Easy State,5.0,5,5,5,"So, like many others here I’ve suffered from PTSD, and mild depression. I also have panic attacks and feelings at times of negative thoughts and feelings of being unsafe. I talked with my psychiatrist, and I even suggested a Benzo, she immediately dismissed it. She said told me the last thing she wanted to give any medication starting off that could have major side effects. So she prescribed me this. I’m usually not the type to takes medications, and I would rather deal with any problem holistically fist. But since none of the things I was trying seeming to help she prescribed me Vistaril (Hydroxazdizine). I took this pill between the nighttime window of 6-8 pm at night. It was a great experience. Within an hour, I felt completely exalted and euphoric. And within two hours I was sleep. Though, I did toss and turn my first night, considering it was just my first time taking it does need time to get in your bloodstream to actually give a full effect within 3-5 days. That didn’t takeaway that this was a great choice to give. I don’t have side-effects and it’s the same class as Benadryl. It makes you sleepy and drowsy. To avoid dry mouth drink plenty of water. Plus I’ve gotten my appetite back. Hope this helps. Read More Read Less  "

One dose lasts all night and has a strong anxiolytic effect the next day and even into the following night.  As a result, I only have to take one dose every 2-3 days.  One apparent side effect that concerns me is that after taking a 50mg dose at bedtime, I definitely feel agitated for hours the following morning after getting out of bed.

I am not addicted, but feel really    functional again.  His final words on Visteral was "" I never prescribe that in my practice.

I had a major panic attack at night and that was forcing me to stay up because I was afraid it would happen again. It got to the point I went into the ER and this is what they gave me. I first took 2 pills in the hospital and they did calm my anxiety down a lot. I was a bit drowsy but I still had a hard time sleeping the first night. However it pretty much knocked me out at some point. Second night I only took one pill and was able to sleep 10 hours and felt pretty good the following day. Third night I took one pill again except this time I woke up and felt afraid to go back to sleep after something that happened in my dreams as they were very vivid. I settled myself down after a little but the dreams I had weren’t scary but just seemed very real more than usual. And depersonalization anxiety already makes you feel like your in a dream like state ??. So I might try to go without it for tonight as I just don’t love the feeling it is giving me. Or I might only take half a pill. Overall it does help with anxiety though. Just weird side effects Read More Read Less

2196,Diprolene AF Topical,11/20/2007,55-64,Male,1 to 6 months,Patient,Other,5.0,5,5,5,My Dermatologist prescribed this ointment for me in 1999 as I had developed bald patches on my scalp.  My hair had fallen out to approx the 75% level.  I 'buzz' cut my hair for easier application and within approx 3 weeks little hairs began to grow back.  I recovered all my hair plus it was thicker.  At first it came in a gray color(naturally brown) but soon returned to natural.  Very please.  Now in 2007 I have same problem again.  Believe it is called Alopecia Areta.  Hopefully it will work again. Just moved and need to find another doctor.Read More Read Less

I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone.

My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes. It relaxes me and makes me have a sense of well-being for the rest of the day. It does make me feel drowsy too, but not terribly so."

My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes. It relaxes me and makes me have a sense of well-being for the rest of the day. It does make me feel drowsy too, but not terribly so."

My doctor gave me this to use 'as needed' and I use it when I get hit with a panic attack. My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes. It relaxes me and makes me have a sense of well-being for the rest of the day. It does make me feel drowsy too, but not terribly so."

As for nausea, this was nowhere near as effective as Phenergan (promethazine) but it had noticeable anti emetic effects that were clouded by drowsiness. 
I thought these were capsule only. I got tablets which compared to the faster acting capsules were awful tasting and hard to cut. Ask for the capsules. 
I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone. I'm on Valium 10mg so they do nothing for my anxiety/panic but they are a nice way to fall asleep. Read More Read Less  "

My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes.

I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone.

I thought these were capsule only. I got tablets which compared to the faster acting capsules were awful tasting and hard to cut. Ask for the capsules. 
I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone.

My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes. It relaxes me and makes me have a sense of well-being for the rest of the day. It does make me feel drowsy too, but not terribly so."

I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone.

My doctor gave me this to use 'as needed' and I use it when I get hit with a panic attack. My panic attacks make my chest feel tight and warm, breathing is hard and my heart starts racing while I'm terrified. A single 25mg dose seems to work well for me to calm me down within 10 minutes. It relaxes me and makes me have a sense of well-being for the rest of the day. It does make me feel drowsy too, but not terribly so."

As for nausea, this was nowhere near as effective as Phenergan (promethazine) but it had noticeable anti emetic effects that were clouded by drowsiness. 
I thought these were capsule only. I got tablets which compared to the faster acting capsules were awful tasting and hard to cut. Ask for the capsules. 
I find Hydroxyzine, or Vistaril/Atarax to be one of the better anti-histamines, not as good as Nordlex (orphenadrine) but better than Benadryl. It relaxes muscles slightly and can help calm someone. I'm on Valium 10mg so they do nothing for my anxiety/panic but they are a nice way to fall asleep. Read More Read Less  "

HOWEVER, if i skip it for a day or two, it comes right back.  Everyone else seems to be cured permanently after a few weeks of using this.  Not the case for me.  I hope I don't have to use this daily for the next 30 years.Read More Read Less  "

After only a couple of uses I was no longer itching and burning.
